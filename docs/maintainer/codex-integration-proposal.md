# Codex Integration Research And Implementation Proposal

Status: researched and designed; not implemented or enabled. Research date:
2026-09-25.

The intended result is access to OCG models from Codex Desktop and CLI while
retaining ChatGPT login, native models, and existing conversations. Preserving
login means that integration neither replaces credentials nor switches
authentication methods. Account revocation, native authentication expiry, and
official outages remain subject to Codex's normal authentication behavior.

## What OpenCodex Does

The highest-star matching repository was `lidge-jun/opencodex` (16,214 stars
when checked). Source review is pinned to
`87a78e5f26f81373bf57c39495037849bd7996f0`. The full OpenCodex application was
not executed.

- Default local injection changes root `openai_base_url`, retaining the
  built-in `openai` provider identity. Existing conversations can resolve their
  original provider without rewriting history. [Injection plan](https://github.com/lidge-jun/opencodex/blob/87a78e5f26f81373bf57c39495037849bd7996f0/src/codex/inject/plan.ts#L203-L263)
- Independent admission credentials, explicit authless mode, or client
  compaction policy select a dedicated provider instead. Normal login mode
  retains `requires_openai_auth = true`; authless operation is a separate
  opt-in. [Configuration generation](https://github.com/lidge-jun/opencodex/blob/87a78e5f26f81373bf57c39495037849bd7996f0/src/codex/inject/config-toml.ts#L125-L150)
- The native OpenAI route forwards incoming login credentials only to the
  canonical official destination. Third-party routes use their own provider
  authentication. [Passthrough adapter](https://github.com/lidge-jun/opencodex/blob/87a78e5f26f81373bf57c39495037849bd7996f0/src/adapters/openai-responses/passthrough.ts#L194-L245)
- The catalog combines native and routed entries, handles name collisions, and
  can be selected through `model_catalog_json`. [Catalog construction](https://github.com/lidge-jun/opencodex/blob/87a78e5f26f81373bf57c39495037849bd7996f0/src/codex/catalog/build-entries.ts)

OpenCodex also manages account pools, OAuth refresh, and history migrations.
This proposal adopts the routing, configuration ownership, and catalog
projection ideas needed for the requested integration.

Official documentation supports overriding the built-in provider with
`openai_base_url`. Custom providers cannot reuse the reserved `openai` name,
and machine-level provider configuration cannot live in project
`.codex/config.toml`. [Advanced configuration](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/config-file/config-advanced)

## Local Observations

Installed Codex CLI `0.153.4` was exercised with three isolated `CODEX_HOME`
directories, synthetic login credentials, and a local HTTP fixture. No real
authentication file was read and no real model credential was used. Test-only
`chatgpt_base_url` and proxy environment settings also redirected account
requests locally; they are not proposed product settings.

| Configuration | Model request authentication | Login file and status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Root `openai_base_url` | Synthetic ChatGPT bearer | File hash unchanged; still reports ChatGPT login |
| Dedicated provider, `requires_openai_auth=true` and `env_key` | Synthetic OCG bearer | Same |
| Dedicated provider, `requires_openai_auth=true` and custom `x-api-key` header | Synthetic ChatGPT bearer plus OCG Key | Same |

The root override requested `/v1/models?client_version=0.153.4`, attempted
WebSocket GETs at `/v1/responses`, and fell back to POST with
`Content-Encoding: zstd`. Dedicated providers did not advertise WebSockets and
used ordinary HTTP POST.

All three configurations rendered the local fixture reply and exited with code
0. These observations establish separation of cached login and model transport
for this CLI build. They do not prove long-term real-account refresh, Desktop
UI behavior, third-party inference, or a complete tool loop.

The official authentication page still says `requires_openai_auth=true` ignores
`env_key`; the installed CLI and current OpenCodex source show the opposite
precedence. Record this as version-specific evidence and probe capabilities
rather than assuming the same behavior on every build. [Authentication](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/auth#alternative-model-providers)

## Recommended Design

Retain the `openai` identity by default and add a Codex-specific local
entrypoint inside the existing OCG process. Ordinary `/v1` Gateway endpoints
keep their existing OCG Key authentication.

```

### Configuration and login

The Host previews and manages root `openai_base_url` and an OCG-owned catalog
path. It does not modify login caches, OS credentials, `chatgpt_base_url`,
`forced_login_method`, history databases, or session files. Preserve the model
default and let users select newly available models.

Bind a dedicated `127.0.0.1` listener and verify readiness before backing up and
atomically updating configuration. Ask the user to restart or start a fresh task
when needed: a successful configuration write does not establish that a running
task switched routes. Restoration changes only fields whose current values
still match OCG's ownership record, preserving subsequent user edits.

Roll back failed configuration, binding, or catalog writes. Normal disablement
restores configuration first. After a crash, expose a clear connection error
and recovery action instead of silently changing providers.

### Local access boundary

A root URL override cannot attach an independent OCG Key like a custom provider
can. This mode therefore needs a separate local entrypoint bound to a
user-selected, dedicated OCG Key with appropriate limits. Third-party execution
uses that Key's existing permissions and metering.

This mode trusts local processes able to reach that port. Loopback binding,
Host/Origin checks, and an endpoint allowlist restrict remote and browser access
but cannot prove the caller is Codex. An arbitrary bearer token is not
authentication. The enablement preview must disclose that local applications can
use the bound Key. Do not publish this listener to LAN/Docker or weaken
ordinary Gateway authentication.

For independently authenticated requests, offer a dedicated `ocg` provider
retaining `requires_openai_auth=true` and separate OCG credentials. Validate
Desktop environment inheritance and conversation restoration separately.
Existing `openai` conversations remain native; this alternative must not be
described as providing identical continuity.

### Two request paths

1. Native models are exact entries from the actual native catalog and use
   fixed official HTTPS destinations. Forward only required authentication
   headers, prohibit credential-bearing redirects, and neither retain nor
   independently refresh refresh tokens. Codex handles genuine native
   authentication failures.
2. OCG models have a stable client mapping such as `ocg/<public model name>`.
   Resolve the exact public name and reuse routing, quotas, logs, and
   conversion. Strip ChatGPT Authorization, account identifiers, and cookies
   before entering this branch; execute under the bound OCG Key identity.
3. Do not infer destinations from prefixes such as `gpt-`. Reject unknown
   names, collisions, and stale mappings; never fail over across credential
   domains. Report third-party authentication failures accurately without
   presenting them as ChatGPT logout or triggering its login refresh.

Retain native metadata and project OCG models visible to the chosen Key that
pass Codex capability validation. Scope native catalogs and cached entitlement
conclusions to the account. Preserve native model instructions and
capabilities; use evidence-backed tool, image, context, and reasoning settings
for third-party entries rather than copying all native capabilities.

### Protocol adaptation

Existing foundations are `crates/ocg-core/src/gateway/mod.rs`, `handler.rs`,
and `crates/ocg-gateway/src/protocol.rs`: Responses, Chat Completions, Messages
conversion, and custom/namespace tool mapping. OCG currently requires
`store=false`, rejects `previous_response_id` and `conversation`, and does not
support some grammar tools.

The Codex entrypoint must handle observed zstd requests with a decompressed-size
bound. Establish correct WebSocket negotiation or reliable HTTP fallback,
rather than hiding a missing feature behind repeated connection failures.
Preserve required native semantics and validate third-party conversion through
actual Codex tool calls.

`/responses/compact` and long-conversation restoration are required. Native
requests may pass through; third-party conversations need compatible
third-party compaction or verified client compaction, never an undisclosed
transfer to an official model. First establish whether the client supplies
complete history; add minimal continuation state only if runtime evidence
requires it. Never silently discard continuation IDs, tool results, or
encrypted reasoning/compaction items. Require a fresh task explicitly when
cross-model continuation cannot preserve their meaning.

## Implementation Order And Acceptance

1. Build an isolated acceptance harness for the CLI and Desktop runtimes
   actually used: login state, account endpoints, catalog, SSE, WebSocket,
   compression, tool loops, cancellation, and restoration.
2. Implement the local listener and credential-isolated branches in the
   existing Host. Reuse the Gateway; no separate daemon, account store, or
   general plugin framework is required.
3. Add **Applications > Codex** with detection, a change preview, Key
   selection, enablement, catalog refresh, and restoration. Follow V4 CAS, Host
   fingerprints, and Pinia ownership. Update schema, generated types, and
   paired user guides.
4. Enable the feature only after native and at least one OCG model complete
   multi-turn tool use, and real login, existing conversations, restart,
   compaction, and removal pass acceptance. Local capture endpoints must prove
   that third parties never receive ChatGPT credentials and their 401/429
   failures do not affect official login.

This delivery contains research and an implementation proposal. It does not
change user Codex configuration, install OpenCodex, or route the current task
through OCG. Real Desktop and provider acceptance remain implementation work.
Show the final global configuration changes and obtain authorization before
enabling them.
