# Storage And Migrations

Operator contract for upgrades, backups, and rollback. Schema details are in [Persistence](state-and-lifecycle.md#persistence).

## Data directories and cipher identity

Every database open uses the Host-resolved cipher (`Database::open_with_cipher` on CLI, desktop, and Docker). Stored account ciphertext is probed before migration and decryption errors fail closed. Key storage uses unauthenticated obfuscation: a successful UTF-8 decode alone cannot authenticate cipher identity. Retain the original cipher; rewriting ciphertext does not repair a mismatch.

| Surface | Default data directory | Cipher identity |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Windows desktop (Tauri) | `%USERPROFILE%\.ocg-mgr` | `MachineBoundCipher` from `USERNAME`, `COMPUTERNAME`, and `APPDATA`. The data directory is not the cipher seed; there is no `.encryption-key` on this path. |
| macOS / Linux desktop (Tauri) | `~/.ocg-mgr` | `StaticKeyCipher` from `<data-dir>/.encryption-key` (created on first launch). |
| CLI | `~/.ocg-mgr-cli`, or `--data-dir <path>` | Priority: `--encryption-key` > `OCG_MANAGER_ENCRYPTION_KEY` > `<data-dir>/.encryption-key`. |
| Docker | container `--data-dir /data` (Compose volume `ocg-data`) | Same CLI resolution. Optional `OCG_MANAGER_ENCRYPTION_KEY` is an explicit restore override; a normal volume keeps `.encryption-key`. Files in `/data` must stay writable by UID/GID `10001`. |

Keep each surface on its own cipher identity:

- Windows desktop data cannot decrypt account ciphertext on another Windows user or machine, nor under the CLI/Docker static cipher.
- Copying a GUI directory onto the CLI default path (or the reverse) uses a different directory and, on Windows, a different cipher.
- If the process was started with `--encryption-key` or `OCG_MANAGER_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, restoring only `.encryption-key` is not enough; supply the same explicit secret again.

## Upgrades and backups

SQLite migrations run in place when the GUI or CLI starts. Before opening a newer binary:

1. Stop every process that has the data directory open (desktop tray **Quit**, CLI Ctrl+C / service stop, `docker compose stop`). WAL files belong with `data.sqlite`.
2. Back up the **whole** data directory, including `.encryption-key` and `browser-profiles/` when present; for Docker, both `ocg-data` and `ocg-browser-profiles`. Keep the matching cipher material listed above.
3. The signed desktop updater manages its own stop and restart; CLI and Docker upgrades stay manual.

Downgrades are not supported: never point an older binary at a migrated database. To roll back, restore the whole-directory backup made before the upgrade.

## Schema v27 and the pre-v3 snapshot

`CURRENT_SCHEMA_VERSION = 38` (`crates/ocg-core/src/db.rs`). Opening a historical database first migrates canonically to v26, then the v27 rewrite copies the primary Key and every `sub_gateway_keys` row into one `access_keys` table (live primary id `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001`), drops `sub_gateway_keys`, and drops the five legacy `accounts.usage_sync_*` columns (usage-sync metadata lives in `provider_usage_sync_state`). v33 adds the exact Custom upstream model identity; v34 adds the singleton CPA configuration table without importing or exporting CPA state. v35 collapses Provider/Plan identity to `provider_id` only: it preflights every known v34 provider/offering pair, refuses unknown pairs and lossy composite-key collisions before mutation, then rebuilds affected tables so offering columns are absent. v36 additively created `ollama_cloud_usage_state` for the unreleased Cookie-usage scrape. v37 drops that table without touching account Keys or logs, and creates `ollama_cloud_billing`. v38 adds administrator-confirmed cross-Provider Alias bindings without creating any rows automatically. Account `key_cipher` / `password_cipher` bytes are validated with the Host cipher and never re-encrypted.

## Schema v31 — per-model/per-protocol overrides

v31 creates the `provider_contract_model_protocol_overrides` table. It stores one row per contract scope × model × protocol, with `state` ∈ `force_on` / `force_off`; an absent row means "auto". The composite primary key is `(scope_kind, scope_id, model_id, protocol)`. The `provider_contract_scopes` switch columns remain in the database for backward compatibility. Effective contract derivation reads `provider_contract_model_protocol_overrides`.

## Schema v32 — single-protocol Custom Endpoint

v32 replaces `account_custom_configs.base_url`, JSON `upstream_protocols`, and `auth_scheme` with `endpoint_url` and one `upstream_protocol`. Historical rows choose Chat Completions, then Responses, then Messages, append that protocol's standard inference suffix, and are disabled with verification reset to `pending`. Capabilities, evidence, and overrides for non-selected protocols are removed in the same transaction. Administrators must review and explicitly re-enable migrated Custom accounts.

## Schema v35 — Provider single identity

v35 removes the offering dimension. Provider and Plan are one product identity keyed by `provider_id`. Known v34 pairs map as `opencode/go`, `opencode-zen-free/anonymous-free`, `command-code/goat`, `minimax/cn`, `kimi/cn`, `custom/api`, and `cpa/local`. Unknown pairs and composite-key collisions fail closed before any write. The rebuild preserves accounts, ciphertext bytes, logs, pricing/catalog rows, contracts, Custom configs/capabilities, settings, and access keys. The same schema version also stores typed user-defined Providers in `dynamic_providers` and `dynamic_provider_models`. Node backups export payload V4 with `providerId` only, plus an optional/defaulted user-defined Provider definition collection. Payload V1–V3 are rejected with an explicit unsupported-version error.

Before any destructive v35 rebuild on a non-empty v34 database, the process writes a unique never-overwritten sibling snapshot:

```text
data.sqlite.pre-v35.<timestamp>.bak
data.sqlite.pre-v35.<timestamp>.bak.sha256
```

The snapshot is a standalone v34 SQLite file (`VACUUM INTO`, `quick_check` on both sides); the sidecar's first field is the lowercase SHA-256 of the `.bak`. A brand-new empty directory creates the current schema directly and does not write this copy. Verify the sidecar from the data directory before any restore:

```bash
sha256sum -c data.sqlite.pre-v35.<timestamp>.bak.sha256      # Linux
shasum -a 256 -c data.sqlite.pre-v35.<timestamp>.bak.sha256  # macOS
```

## Schema v36 — Ollama Cloud usage state

v36 creates the `ollama_cloud_usage_state` table. One row per configured
account holds:

- `cookie_cipher` — the obfuscated browser-session Cookie for the
  `https://ollama.com/settings` usage scrape. It uses the same
  key-obfuscation facility as account keys and is explicitly not
  AEAD; it is never returned by any API and never enters an export payload.
- `status` — `unconfigured`, `ok`, `unauthorized`, or `failed`.
- `snapshot` — the sanitized JSON from the last successful scrape (5h/7d
  windows, per-model request counts, optional plan/balance). Written only on
  success; failures update status columns and never clear it.
- `last_error`, `last_success_at`, `last_attempt_at`, `next_eligible_at`,
  `failure_streak` — manual-refresh throttle (30 seconds) and last-attempt
  metadata.

The row is keyed by `account_id` with `ON DELETE CASCADE`, so account
deletion removes the usage state; clearing the Cookie deletes the row and
returns the capability to the unconfigured state. The migration is additive:
existing tables, rows, and routing facts stay as they are. It does not create
a new backup family. Rollback remains the existing whole-directory restore.

## Schema v37 — Ollama Cloud billing

v37 drops `ollama_cloud_usage_state` (the unreleased Cookie scrape, including
obfuscated Cookie ciphertext and last-good snapshots) and creates
`ollama_cloud_billing`:

- `account_id` — primary key, `ON DELETE CASCADE`
- `billing_tier` — `pro` / `max` / `team`

Absence of a row is unconfigured (`null` on the account field). Existing
Ollama accounts migrate with no row, stay routeable, and keep their Keys and
logs. New creates require a paid tier and `accounts.purchase_date`. Node
export/import carries the billing tier. The migration does not create a new
backup family. Rollback remains the existing whole-directory restore.

## Schema v38 — user model Alias bindings

v38 creates `user_model_alias_bindings`, keyed by `(alias, provider_id)`. Each
row stores one lowercase public Alias and one exact upstream model ID selected
from that sealed Provider's current catalog. The migration creates no rows:
catalog and pricing refreshes never guess model equivalence. Dashboard V3
replaces the complete binding set under CAS after validating catalog membership,
enabled protocol state, duplicate Providers, and conflicts with existing raw or
built-in routes. Removing a later catalog row makes the saved mapping
unroutable rather than retargeting it. Existing accounts, Keys, logs, static
Aliases, and Provider contracts are untouched. Rollback remains the existing
whole-directory restore. Node export/import carries the complete binding set.

## Schema v33 — Custom upstream model identity

v33 adds the non-null `account_model_capabilities.upstream_model` column.
Existing rows are backfilled from `model_id`, preserving their former
public-name = upstream-ID behavior exactly. New Custom mappings may retain a
distinct public model name and exact upstream model ID; no suffix normalization
or generated Alias is applied by this migration.

Before any v27 write, an existing (non-empty) library gets a unique, never-overwritten sibling snapshot:

```text
data.sqlite.pre-v3.<timestamp>.bak
data.sqlite.pre-v3.<timestamp>.bak.sha256
```

The snapshot is a standalone v26 SQLite file (`VACUUM INTO`, `quick_check` on both sides); the sidecar's first field is the lowercase SHA-256 of the `.bak`. A brand-new empty directory creates the current schema directly and does not write this copy. The snapshot is a rollback point, not a substitute for the whole-directory backup. Verify the sidecar from the data directory before any restore:

```bash
sha256sum -c data.sqlite.pre-v3.<timestamp>.bak.sha256      # Linux
shasum -a 256 -c data.sqlite.pre-v3.<timestamp>.bak.sha256  # macOS
```

On Windows, compare `Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256` with the first field of the sidecar. A hash mismatch means do not restore that file.

## Rollback and failed opens

**There is no down-migration.** Rollback is an offline, exact-file restore:

1. Stop every process that has the directory open.
2. Verify the sidecar hash as above; stop if it does not match.
3. Copy the verified `.bak` over `data.sqlite`, and remove the stale `data.sqlite-wal` / `data.sqlite-shm` left behind by the previous live file.
4. Start a v26-capable binary with the same cipher identity, or retry the v27 upgrade on that restored v26 file. Restoring after a successful v27 open discards every write made since the snapshot.

A failed v27 transaction rolls back: the live file must remain schema 26 with `sub_gateway_keys` intact. Leave any pre-v3 files in place; a later successful open creates another unique name instead of overwriting. A wrong or missing Host cipher fails closed; never rewrite `key_cipher` / `password_cipher`. `ocg-manager-cli status` opens the database and will attempt v27, so it migrates rather than inspecting schema read-only.
