# Architecture

This page defines stable dependency and ownership boundaries. Runtime edge
cases, schema history, route inventories, and release procedures live in
their own chapters.

## Dependency Graph

```text
ocg-gateway -> ocg-domain
ocg-core    -> ocg-domain + ocg-gateway + ocg-infra
ocg-cli     -> ocg-core
src-tauri   -> ocg-core

ocg-browser-worker   separate process; no internal ocg-* dependency
Vue SPA              static assets; HTTP Dashboard V4 only
```

The **Adapter Registry** is static and sealed. Runtime Provider definitions
are typed data bound to Configurable HTTP.

| Crate | Owns | Must not own |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ocg-domain` | IDs, `BUILTIN_PROVIDERS`, `ProviderAdapterKind`, protocol tables, typed dynamic definitions | DB, `CoreState`, HTTP clients, filesystem, clocks |
| `ocg-gateway` | Alias resolution, `AttemptSpec`, classification, selector state machines, no-I/O JSON conversion | DB, `CoreState`, plaintext credentials, outbound HTTP |
| `ocg-infra` | Key obfuscation, proxy-aware HTTP helpers, inference transport, SQLite log statements | Product catalogs, Dashboard DTOs, routing policy |
| `ocg-core` | SQLite, `CoreState`, Dashboard control plane, adapters, gateway execution, usage sync, Host composition | Runtime plugin loading; adapter-owned DB or HTTP clients |
| `ocg-cli` / `src-tauri` | Process composition for CLI and Desktop | A second control plane or direct WebView mutation path |

`ocg-domain::credential` holds the identity/credential/binding vocabulary and
the single legacy mapper.

Compatibility facades live in `ocg-core`; new no-I/O catalog, selector,
alias, and conversion behavior belongs in the lower crates.

## HTTP Composition

`crates/ocg-core/src/host_router.rs` is the composition root for one listener:

```text
127.0.0.1:9042
  inference routes
    OpenAI Chat / Responses / Anthropic Messages
    Gemini generateContent / streamGenerateContent
    local GET /v1/models
  /dashboard/api/v3       410 tombstone
  /dashboard/api/v4       live Dashboard control plane
  /dashboard/api          preserved auth + browser WS; other REST -> 410 tombstone
  /dashboard/             Vue SPA and assets
```

The SPA remains an HTTP client. Desktop capabilities are registered into
`CoreState`.

## Gateway Request Path

Inference is implemented under `crates/ocg-core/src/gateway/`:

1. `handler.rs` assigns the request id, authenticates a client Key, parses the
   client protocol, and resolves model identity.
2. `GatewayExecutor` captures one request-entry snapshot for proxy
   routes, contracts, and Alias resolution. It does not capture a price
   snapshot for a new request. Fallback iterations re-read live
   account state, eligible Custom runtimes, and Zen Free cooldown. Protocol
   selection is made again for each attempt from that saved contract: the
   saved preferred protocol, then the enabled client protocol, then the
   remaining granted protocols. Local preservation picks one of those
   candidates before that attempt's send. An HTTP 400 does not switch
   protocol. Credential and provider retries stay in the outer loop below.
3. Candidate materialization applies adapter ceilings and effective
   model/protocol state before the no-I/O selector chooses a card.
4. `provider_adapter.rs` exhaustively maps the sealed `ProviderAdapterKind` to
   a data-only `AttemptSpec`. It does not decrypt Keys, open SQLite, or build an
   HTTP client.
5. The Host resolves the selected credential. `forward_once` performs exactly
   one upstream `.send()`; retry and fallback policy stay in the outer loop.
6. Classification decides same-account retry, account fallback, cooldown, or
   terminal return. The Host then converts the response and writes logs
   (`requested_model`, `resolved_alias`, `upstream_model`).

Unknown or ambiguous model identity fails before outbound HTTP. Timeouts,
stream interruptions, and other outcomes that may have reached the upstream
are not automatically replayed. Full status-specific behavior lives in
[Runtime invariants](runtime-invariants.md).

## Adapter And Provider Boundary

`ocg-domain::ProviderRegistry` contains the code-owned built-in Provider rows
and exhaustive adapter kinds. Unknown `provider_id` values fail closed unless
they match a persisted typed Provider definition, which always selects the
existing Configurable HTTP adapter.

Legacy Custom API rows are distinct configurable `http` destinations using
the same sealed adapter kind. A connection may hold multiple credentials while
preserving public-name-only resolution. CPA is a separate static external
integration.

Provider-owned catalogs and contracts are resolved before account credentials
are used. Saved discovery rows may activate code-owned Alias mappings or remain
exact raw pins.

## Control Plane

The Vue SPA calls remounted operational handlers through
`src/api/dashboard-v3.ts` (HTTP base `/dashboard/api/v4`) and native V4 routes
through `src/api/dashboard-v4.ts` (presenters in `src/api/connections.ts`).
`/dashboard/api/v3` is a 410 tombstone. Live dashboard JSON is V4 only.
CAS-protected mutations carry `expectedRevision` and `processGeneration`.
There is no pricing write and no `expectedPricingRevision`. Operational reads and
diagnostics that do not mutate state skip CAS.

The CLI calls the same HTTP-neutral services without an argv CAS token. Shared
services own persistence and revision bumps for both the CLI and the frontend.

The settings-specific persist/rebind/compensation sequence is shown in
[Dashboard API](dashboard-api.md#settings-mutation-workflow). Account setup
states are shown in
[State and lifecycle](state-and-lifecycle.md#managed-account-setup-lifecycle).
