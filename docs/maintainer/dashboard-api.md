# Dashboard API

## Billing (V4)

`GET /dashboard/api/v4/accounts/{id}/billing` presents observed quota windows,
official balances, and stored manual credit balances together with available
actions. Here `id` identifies one account (one Key); several accounts in a
supplier container remain independent. The read makes no upstream request and
does not settle, reprice, or advance stored balances. Existing official balance
and quota refresh endpoints retain their provider-specific observation adapters.

`PUT .../billing/credits` records manual buckets. It does not accept token
rates or a currency conversion. `POST .../billing/credits/calibrate` corrects
current bucket balances, `POST .../billing/credits/grants` adds a grant, and
`DELETE .../billing/credits` disables the manual balance. Mutations require
`expectedRevision` and `processGeneration` and return `BillingStatus`.

Only an explicit manual edit changes the stored balance. Reading, opening,
exporting, or a new inference request does not. A read may show a stored grant
past its saved expiry without writing that expiry back. A new request does not
debit personal credit. An empty or unknown balance does not change routing
eligibility.

Historical `credit_meter_json` and `credit_receipt_json` remain readable. A
stored pending receipt stays byte-exact. A billing read reports active
`pendingRequests` as 0. Explicit calibration writes that meter's balance. The
historical receipt does not block that write, and the write does not settle or
delete the receipt. Opening does not settle it, and export does not collapse it.

The configuration written here is the name, currency, monthly amount, and
source URL. A portable import keeps legacy rates stored for historical
compatibility. It rebuilds a validated meter and does not call
`CreditMeterState::new` or `advance`. Binding and meter ids are new. The
monthly expiry, expired buckets, configuration, counters, monthly cursor,
`created_at`, and `last_calibration_at` stay exact. The remaining charge
attempt returns no debit.

Step Plan keeps manual buckets, monthly renewal, expiry, and calibration. A Step
preset is an amount and a monthly renewal, not a token rate. The former private
console-token endpoints and `StepFunUsageStatus` contract are retired.
StepFun ordinary API balance remains separate from the `/step_plan` channel.

Manual credit is limited to `http` destinations of legacy kind
`custom_account` or `dynamic`. Platform-linked Keys, observer credentials, and
sealed built-in Plans keep their observed billing views.

These pricing routes are not registered and answer with the ordinary V4 404.
There is no new tombstone registry for them:

- `GET /dashboard/api/v4/providers/{id}/pricing`
- `POST /dashboard/api/v4/providers/{id}/pricing/refresh`
- `PUT /dashboard/api/v4/providers/{id}/pricing/multipliers`
- `GET /dashboard/api/v4/providers/{id}/official-api/pricing`
- `POST /dashboard/api/v4/providers/{id}/official-api/pricing`

`/dashboard/api/v3` remains a 410 tombstone. The V3 DTO contract toolchain remains.

## Dashboard V3

The `/dashboard/api/v3` HTTP mount is **removed**. The dashboard speaks V4
only. Anonymous `/dashboard/api/v3` and `/dashboard/api/v3/*` return
empty-body **401** (auth runs before the tombstone). Authenticated requests
(including loopback local mode) return **410**
`{ "code": "dashboardV3Removed", "message": "Dashboard API V3 has been removed; refresh the page and retry." }`.

Operational V3 handlers are remounted under `/dashboard/api/v4` with the same
relative paths, except the account-list shim is `GET /account-records` so it
does not collide with V4 `GET /accounts` (identities). `GET /contract` is the
existing V4 ControlRevision. **The remounted handlers are a compatibility
shim** over the destination and credential tables. New clients should use V4
`GET /destinations` and `GET /credentials`. Remounted listings reconstruct from
destinations and credentials. Key ciphertext stays on credential SQL rows and
never appears on V4 GET destination/credential DTOs. DTOs are camelCase,
mutation bodies deny unknown fields, and nullable response fields serialize as
`T | null`.

Control-plane identity:

- `settings_revision` — in-memory `AtomicU64` on `CoreState`, bumped after
  a successful persist. Not stored in SQLite as the CAS token.
- `process_generation` — assigned once per `CoreState`, never persisted.
  A CAS token from a previous process cannot be reused after restart.
- `pricingRevision` — generated `ControlRevision` still includes this legacy
  read string, and Rust `ControlRevision::from_state` still copies the in-memory
  pricing snapshot revision. It is not a CAS token, and it is not removed. The
  live dashboard client publishes only `revision` and `processGeneration`. There
  is no pricing mutation. Do not send `expectedPricingRevision`.

`GET /contract` returns the current process's live revision / generation token
(`ControlRevision`: `revision`, `processGeneration`).

Mutations require top-level `expectedRevision` and `processGeneration`
(including `/auth/register`, `/auth/login`, `/auth/logout`, and
`POST /accounts/{id}/usage/refresh`). A missing `expectedRevision` returns
`400` `missingExpectedRevision`; a mismatch returns `409` `revisionConflict`
with `currentRevision` and `processGeneration` in the error envelope. The Vue
`controlPlane` store records both tokens from every remounted V3 payload. On 409
the client refreshes the control tokens and affected resource without replaying
the mutation; the user can review current state and submit again. Tokens are
process-local and do not coordinate separate processes sharing a data
directory.

Operations that are not mutations skip CAS and never bump revision:
operational diagnostics such as `POST /settings/test-proxy` and
`POST /custom/models/discover`; update checks such as
`GET /settings/check-update` and `GET /settings/update-status` capture tokens
without bumping. `POST /settings/install-update` requires CAS and starts
atomically, but does not bump and holds no network or DB lock.

Plaintext keys never appear on `Settings`, provider, Zen, or contract DTOs.
`ConnectionInfo` (`GET /connection`) is the only secret-bearing V3 response:
it returns the primary key and every non-deleted sub-key value, including
disabled sub-keys, under dashboard session protection. Only enabled keys enter
the authentication snapshot. `CustomModelDiscoveryRequest.apiKey` is write-only.
Account list/get payloads stay secret-free. Logs and error envelopes redact
known secrets. A confirmed Key create or rotate acknowledgement is committed
even when the following `GET /connection` fails. The acknowledgement does not
include plaintext. After rotation or revocation the previous plaintext is
blank. Recovery is another GET. The client must not create or rotate the Key
again.

The frozen contract is `schema/dashboard-api-v3.schema.json`, generated from
`dashboard_v3::contract_schema_pretty()` by
`crates/ocg-core/examples/export_dashboard_v3_schema.rs`. Generated TypeScript
(`src/api/generated/dashboard-v3.ts`) is types only, with no HTTP wrappers.
`CATALOG_TYPE_NAMES` in `dashboard_v3/types.rs` is the ordered `$defs` catalog;
appending must keep existing definitions byte-identical.

The `src/api/dashboard.ts` presentation client wraps `dashboardV3` and projects
the fields each page and store needs.

`dashboard.rs` serves the SPA and preserves the V2 auth and browser WebSocket
handlers. Other `/dashboard/api/...` REST paths are tombstoned in
`host_router` before they reach `dashboard.rs`.

## Dashboard V4

Dashboard V4 JSON is `/dashboard/api/v4`. This is the only live dashboard
JSON prefix: additive V4 routes plus remounted V3 operational handlers.
V3 `$defs` do not gain new fields.

V4 reuses V3 session middleware. Its listings return the same `ControlRevision`
(`expectedRevision` / `processGeneration`) that V3 uses for CAS. V4 mutations
are `POST /onboarding/commit`,
`POST /credentials/{id}/rotate`, `POST /credentials/{id}/quota-retry`,
`PATCH /bindings/{id}`,
`POST /identities/{id}/credentials`, `POST|DELETE /applications/dsh` (which also
binds the GET inspection fingerprint; DELETE has no `keyId`),
`PUT /destinations/{id}/catalog`,
`POST /destinations/{id}/catalog/refresh`, `POST /destinations/{id}/model-tests`,
`POST /platform-accounts/{id}/import-keys`, `PUT /cpa/models`,
`POST /provider-contracts/{scope_kind}/{scope_id}/catalog/remove`, and
`PATCH /alias-publication`; they check those tokens. Read routes
do not.

The checked-in additive V4 contract is
`schema/dashboard-api-v4.schema.json`, generated from
`dashboard_v4::contract_schema_pretty()` by
`crates/ocg-core/examples/export_dashboard_v4_schema.rs`. Generated TypeScript
(`src/api/generated/dashboard-v4.ts`) is types only, with no HTTP wrappers.
`CATALOG_TYPE_NAMES` in `dashboard_v4/types.rs` is the ordered `$defs` catalog;
appending must keep existing definitions byte-identical.

Read-only routes are `GET /contract`, `GET /templates`,
`GET /connections`, `GET /accounts` (identities), `GET /account-records`
(remounted V3 account-list shim), `GET /destinations`, `GET /credentials`,
`GET /accounts/{id}/billing`, `GET /accounts/{id}/official-api`,
`GET /routing/cards`,
`GET /applications/dsh` (optional `profilePath` and `runtimeUrl`),
`GET /cpa/models`, and `GET /alias-publication`. Those reads perform no outbound
requests.

The official-api family — `GET /accounts/{id}/official-api` and
`POST /accounts/{id}/official-api/balance` — exposes official balance evidence
for matching presets. The GET is a local projection; the CAS-protected POST is
the network path. Price-table routes are not registered. See
[Official API Financial Evidence](runtime-invariants.md#official-api-financial-evidence).

`GET /templates` is the read-only add catalog: the sealed built-ins (CPA
excluded) plus the `custom-http` manual template. Presets are not part of the
template catalog. Templates have no user instances or secrets.

`GET /connections` is a projection of saved instances: built-ins that already
have an account and every configurable HTTP connection, including each
persisted Custom API destination grouped with all of its Keys; CPA is never a
connection. Each connection carries lifecycle, authorization state, local
eligibility with a reason, endpoints, model targets, and a legacy identity
reference. Connection ids are deterministic UUIDv5 values derived from that
legacy identity, never from names or URLs.

`GET /accounts` returns `IdentityList { revision, identities[] }`. Each
`IdentitySummary` carries `identity` (`id`, `label`, `authorityRef`
`{ issuerOrSite, tenantOrSubject }`, `identityConfidence`, `enabled`,
`notes`), `credentials[]`, identity-level `declaredRelations[]`
(`platformAccountId`, `group`), and `legacy` (`kind` `account` |
`platform_account`, `id`). The wire shape is nested:
`credentials[].credential` (`id`, `purpose` `inference` |
`platform_observer`, `materialKind` `api_key` | `external_reference`,
`secretRef` — an opaque handle, never material, `hasMaterial`, `version`,
`enabled`, `authState` `unknown` | `valid` | `invalid`,
`authStateVersion`, `expiresAt` null when unknown) with siblings
`subject` (`account_credential` | `anonymous`), `bindings[]` (`id`,
`connectionId`, `allowedEndpointIds`, `allowedOrigins`, `modelScope`,
`enabled`, `routingRank`), `quotaWindows[]`, `onboardingTask`,
`subscription` (null when unknown), `lastError` (redacted; null when it
cannot be redacted safely), and `legacy`. The platform parent's
`platform_observer` credential is a projection (no
`credential_state` row). `authState` is local: `unknown` is never
`valid`; `valid` requires the existing verification record. The Vue
Accounts page overlays this projection for display; Key rotation, quota retry,
binding edits, and additional identity credentials use V4, while the remaining
account mutations stay on V3.

`GET /destinations` and `GET /credentials` are secret-free, revision-tagged,
local-only projections. `DestinationCredentialDto` may include optional
nullable `quotaRecovery` (camelCase). Absence means no confirmed exhaustion,
not verified upstream health. `status` on that object is presentation only
(`waiting` | `ready` | `probing`). `IdentitySummary` credentials do not carry
this field.
CAS-protected `PATCH /destinations/{id}` fully replaces editable HTTP name,
endpoint, auth, protocol, mappings, and route overrides. It never accepts Key
material and unions safe grants
only for explicit `authorizeCredentialIds`. `DELETE /destinations/{id}` requires
zero referencing
credentials. Sealed and platform-managed destinations reject both mutations. A
populated destinations/credentials store is served even when live
`project()` would refuse. An empty store or leftover-table upgrade window
falls back to `project()`; only that empty-store fallback can return
`409` `destinationProjectionRefused` with a `details` array naming each
refused row.

Node transfer (`POST /accounts/transfer/export|preview|import`) is remounted
on V4. The latest export uses the current transfer payload: `destinations` and
`credentials`
(plaintext secrets, platform and CPA observer management credentials, and
identity / grant / cooldown extras stay inside the encrypted envelope), plus
`quotaPools` and `node`, and explicit HTTP protocol routes.
Merging a package that has no CPA observer key preserves the destination's
existing management key. It does not emit
`accounts`, `platformAccounts`, `platformLinks`, `dynamicProviders`, or
`identities`. Those portable types are transfer-only and are not V4 listing
DTOs. The supported import range, per-version defaults, and the
explicit-routes rejection are the node-transfer payload policy in
[runtime invariants](runtime-invariants.md). Local quota recovery is not a
portable field: it is omitted from export, retained on an unchanged target Key,
and cleared when the Key is replaced.

`GET /routing/cards` returns one revision-tagged snapshot of `cards`,
`destinations` and `credentials`. `PUT /routing/cards` accepts CAS tokens and
the complete ordered card list. A card has `id`, `destinationId` and ordered
`credentialIds`; every inference credential, including disabled rows, must
appear exactly once under its existing destination. Observer credentials are
excluded.

Layout and flattened routing ranks commit together, and the response returns the
complete committed snapshot. Multiple cards share one destination; creating or
removing an empty extra card does not create or delete a supplier.

`GET /routing/explain?model=...&clientProtocol=...` is read-only and
authenticated. It reuses live alias resolution, route materialization,
availability gates, and a clone-based base-policy preview. It never sends,
decrypts a Key, probes DNS, writes logs/cooldowns/quota recovery, or advances
sticky, round-robin or quota-trial state. The response includes eligible Keys,
typed exclusions, effective upstream protocol/global rank, and explicit
runtime-only uncertainties.

V4 does not treat authorization `unknown` as `valid`. Eligibility is a local
projection, never upstream health.

`POST /onboarding/commit` body: `expectedRevision`, `processGeneration` (the
same CAS tokens as V3), `operationId` (client-generated UUID), `connection`,
optional `authorization`, and `targets`.

`connection` is `kind: new` (`templateId` is `custom-http` or a preset id,
plus `name`, `endpointUrl`, `upstreamProtocol`, `authKind`) or
`kind: existing` (`connectionId`). `authorization` is `kind: api_key`
(`secretInput`, optional `accountLabel` / `notes`) or `kind: none`.
`targets` map a public model to an exact upstream model, with an optional
per-target upstream override. `new` requires a non-empty `targets` list;
`existing` requires it empty (connection edits use V4 `PATCH /destinations/{id}`).

Evaluation order: (1) parse; (2) `operationId` must be a UUID; (3) take the
`settings_update` lock, then idempotency lookup before CAS — if that
`operationId` was already committed with the same
payload digest, the stored secret-free result is returned with `replayed:
true` and the current revision tokens, without checking CAS (the first write
already moved the revision); the same `operationId` with a different payload
returns `409` `operationPayloadMismatch` and writes nothing; (4) CAS check
(`409` `revisionConflict`); (5) write.

`new` reuses V3 user-defined Provider validation. Template ids pass through as
opaque preset ids; preset forms stay frontend-owned and Rust consumes only the
offering projection generated from `resources/provider-presets.json`.
Omitting `authorization`
on keyed auth saves the definition only (V4 connections then show
authorization `missing`); `api_key` requires a non-empty secret on keyed
auth; `none` is valid only for no-auth templates, which always create the
singleton account. The Provider row, optional first account row, and the
operation record commit in one SQLite transaction; the dynamic-provider
snapshot is installed after commit exactly as V3 does.

`existing` accepts a new `api_key` on keyed dynamic Providers and legacy
Custom HTTP connections. Built-in, platform-managed, and no-auth
connection ids return `400`. Account row and
operation record commit in one transaction, then the revision bump only
(`reload_contracts=false`), the same as V3 plain account create.

The result is `{ revision, connectionId, credentialId | null, targetIds,
replayed }`. `connectionId` is the deterministic UUIDv5 of the dynamic
Provider; `credentialId` is the account id; `targetIds` are UUIDv5 per public
model. The response never contains the secret, ciphers, or the digest.

**Idempotent operations.** `operationId` plus a payload digest bind a commit:
the digest is hex HMAC-SHA256 over the semantic payload only — `operationId`,
`connection`, `authorization` (so the secret is covered), and `targets`.
`expectedRevision` / `processGeneration` are excluded, so a retry with
refreshed CAS tokens still replays. Each commit is stored in
`dashboard_operations`; the stored `result_json` is secret-free. Rows older
than 30 days are pruned on insert; after pruning, the same `operationId` is a
new write.

`POST /credentials/{id}/rotate` replaces the Key on one projected
credential. CAS tokens are required; there is no `operationId`. The
credential id, binding, and quota relationship stay the same. `version`
and `authStateVersion` increment together; `authState` becomes `unknown`;
the underlying account's `auth_error` / `last_error` and verification
result are cleared so the old version cannot pollute the new one.
Rotating replaces the Key and clears local quota recovery. The
body is `{ secretInput }` plus CAS tokens. The result is secret-free.
Platform observer, anonymous, no-auth, and CPA credentials return `400`.
Unknown ids return `404`. A stale CAS token returns `409` and writes
nothing.

`QuotaRecoveryDto` is `{ status: "waiting" | "ready" | "probing", reason:
"quota_exhausted" | "insufficient_balance", window: "five_hours" | "week" |
"month" | "unknown", observedAt: string (RFC3339), resetsAt: string | null,
nextRetryAt: string (RFC3339), failureCount: number }`.

`POST /credentials/{id}/quota-retry` uses the existing flattened
`MutationExpectation` body (`expectedRevision`, `processGeneration`) with no
`operationId`. The result is `{ revision: ControlRevision, credential:
DestinationCredentialDto }` and is secret-free. It permits one next normal
selection: no outbound request, no enablement change, and no backoff clear.
It is idempotent while status is already `ready` or `probing` and may return
the current updated row. Unknown ids return `404`. A stale CAS token returns
`409` and writes nothing.

`PATCH /bindings/{id}` edits one inference binding. CAS tokens are
required; there is no `operationId`. The body is `{ modelScope?, enabled? }`
plus CAS tokens. At least one of `modelScope` or `enabled` is required.
`modelScope` is `{ kind: "all" }` or `{ kind: "only", models: [...] }`
(exact ids after the existing model-name normalization). Binding enablement
is independent of the sibling binding on the same identity. Unknown ids
return `404`. Platform observer, anonymous, no-auth, and CPA bindings
return `400`. A stale CAS token returns `409` and writes nothing. The
result is `{ revision, binding }` and is secret-free.

`POST /identities/{id}/credentials` adds a second Key to a confirmed
identity. CAS tokens are required; there is no `operationId`. The body is
`{ connectionId, secretInput }` plus CAS tokens. The write creates a new
`accounts` row that reuses the existing `identity_id`, inserts
`credential_state` and `credential_bindings`, and joins the identity's
quota pool in one SQLite transaction. A different `connectionId` is a
second product (D05); the same Plan connection is another Key on that
product. Switching Keys does not invent a fresh pool. Unknown identity or
connection ids return `404`. Builtin-immutable / Zen Free / CPA / no-auth
/ Custom API / platform-observer targets return `400`. A stale CAS token
returns `409` and writes nothing. The result is secret-free.

The dashboard consumes `GET /connections` for the Providers rail,
`POST /onboarding/commit` for user-defined Provider creation, and
`GET /accounts` as a display overlay on the Accounts page. The client generates
a new `operationId` when
the draft changes, keeps that id across retries of an unchanged draft, and
regenerates it after success. Editing and deleting accounts and the
remaining Accounts-page operations stay on V3; Key rotation, quota retry,
binding edits, and adding a Key to an existing identity use V4.

## Settings Mutation Workflow

[![Dashboard V3 settings mutation workflow](../diagrams/dashboard-v3-mutation.visual-check.1440x900.light.png)](https://klarkxy.github.io/open-console-gateway/diagrams/dashboard-v3-mutation/)

[Open the interactive diagram on GitHub Pages](https://klarkxy.github.io/open-console-gateway/diagrams/dashboard-v3-mutation/).

This sequence is specific to CAS-protected Settings writes; discovery,
diagnostic, and read operations may skip CAS as described above. The client
submits `expectedRevision` and `processGeneration`. A mismatch returns `409`;
the client refreshes the tokens and affected resource, but does not replay the
write automatically.

After CAS succeeds, the Host persists the new settings and releases the
settings lock. It rebinds the listener only when the port changed and a
listener is running. If rebind fails, the request returns `500` with code
`internal`. Compensation restores the previous port only when the live config
still contains the failed committed port, so a later successful write is not
overwritten.

A confirmed settings acknowledgement means the write is saved. If the following
canonical read fails, that is a separate read warning. The client must not treat
it as a write failure and must not submit the same write again.

A gateway-port change does not navigate by itself. On a direct connection, the
page may offer a link the operator opens. That link keeps the current scheme,
host name, path, query, and hash, and changes only the port. The page does not
follow the link automatically, including when the new port is the loopback port
the dashboard was already using. A reverse-proxy origin stays unchanged. A
failed bind returns the `500` `internal` above, is not success, and does not
offer that link.

## V2 REST Tombstone

Protected Dashboard V2 REST answers with a fixed tombstone.

- Anonymous V2 REST: empty-body **401** (auth runs before the
  tombstone).
- Authenticated V2 REST (including loopback local mode): **410** with
  `{ "code": "dashboardV2Removed", "message": "Dashboard API V2 has been removed; refresh the page and retry." }`.
- Unknown `/dashboard/api/...` paths that are not the V3 tombstone prefix,
  not V4, and not a preserved family are also 410 once authenticated.
  Unknown V4 paths are V4 `404`s, not tombstones.

Preserved `/dashboard/api` families (exact path, no trailing slash, no
extra segments):

- `auth/status`, `auth/register`, `auth/login`, `auth/logout`
- `browser/sessions/{token}/ws` (non-empty token)

The `/dashboard/api/v3` prefix is a separate 410 family
(`dashboardV3Removed`). The Vue shell and product views call
`/dashboard/api/v4` only (`requestV3` and `requestV4` share that base;
`dashboardV3.listAccounts` uses `GET /account-records`). Inference routes,
dashboard HTML, and `/dashboard/assets/...` are outside the tombstone.
