# Model Catalog Refresh

**Refresh model catalog** on **Providers → Models** updates the saved local directory. It is available for each refreshable sealed Provider and every saved configurable HTTP connection. Refresh is a directory operation, not an inference test: it keeps routing state and quota/cooldown state unchanged.

Newly discovered models are saved enabled with the protocols supported by official documentation or the connection's configured routes. On GOAT's first successful refresh, only plan-included models start enabled; other models in that first snapshot stay off until enabled manually. Models first discovered by later GOAT refreshes use the normal enabled default. Existing saved switches stay in effect. A model with no protocol evidence waits for official documentation; when that evidence later arrives, refresh may add and enable the protocol. Existing mappings, preferred protocol, route overrides, Key grants, and probe observations remain unchanged; refresh may add newly documented protocol declarations. Failed, empty, or stale refreshes preserve the previous directory; a partial response is reported as partial.

For configurable HTTP connections, the configured one to three routes define the available protocols. Refresh uses the saved directory route and, where needed, a ready Key already authorized for that route. It never grants a Key, expands a Key's scope, or proves that a model accepts every configured protocol. Manual mappings remain editable when a service has no compatible model-list endpoint.

A connection created before its official preset gained extra protocol routes is migrated by **Refresh model catalog**: the refresh first checks the upstream protocols declared by that preset and appends the missing routes to the connection (keeping every existing address and authentication untouched), then refreshes the directory. The backfill never authorizes any Key for the new protocols; whether a Key may use them stays a manual grant when you edit the connection.

## Protocols, Tests, And Access

The model matrix provides search, an enabled filter, batch enable/disable/delete, protocol preference, per-model test, and refresh. It also keeps the mapping editor for public-name to upstream-ID mappings. Enabling a model enables its declared available protocols; turning it off removes it from routing and `GET /v1/models`.

**Test model** sends one bounded request through the exact saved route and an already authorized ready Key. It does not infer another endpoint, add a grant, change enablement, or change the preferred protocol. Its receipt is tied to the tested scope, Key, and configuration; replacing any of them makes the old observation inapplicable.

An existing single-route connection continues to use its legacy address and authentication. A connection with explicit routes must be edited from **Providers** so the full route set is saved together; Accounts deliberately does not edit its transport.

## Official Directories

OpenCode Go reads the public, keyless [`GET /zen/go/v1/models`](https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1/models) directory and uses the per-model endpoint table in the [Go documentation](https://opencode.ai/docs/go/). For example, `mimo-v2.6-flash` is Chat Completions only. GOAT reads its public [`GET /provider/v1/models`](https://api.commandcode.ai/provider/v1/models) directory and uses each model's documented `supported_endpoints`; documentation takes precedence. The current `xiaomi/mimo-v2.6-flash` entry has Chat Completions and Responses evidence, and does not imply Messages.

MiMo Token Plan can refresh its documented `/models` directory. Its `mimo-v2.6-flash` seed uses Chat Completions, Responses, and Messages. Kimi remains a Chat Completions and Messages Provider. MiniMax CN/API and Global presets expose Chat Completions, Responses, and Messages; the exact saved regional routes and authentication determine a request. Do not infer an undocumented capability merely because another model or Provider supports it.

Catalog refresh does not fetch a price list or estimate request cost. A missing cost stays unknown. It is not shown as zero or free.
