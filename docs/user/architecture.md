# Architecture

Open Console Gateway is one local node. Desktop, CLI, and Docker are alternative hosts
for the same `ocg-core` process. The default listener is `127.0.0.1:9042`.
Each node stores its own data locally.

## One Local Node

[![Open Console Gateway local-node architecture](../diagrams/local-node.visual-check.1440x900.light.png)](https://klarkxy.github.io/open-console-gateway/diagrams/local-node/)

[Open the interactive diagram on GitHub Pages](https://klarkxy.github.io/open-console-gateway/diagrams/local-node/) to switch themes,
trace relationships, or export another format.

The Dashboard and inference endpoints share port `9042`, but they use different
credentials. A client **Key** authenticates an AI tool to Open Console Gateway. After
selection, the account credential is sent only to that account's configured
upstream; Zen Free has no credential. The Vue SPA talks HTTP Dashboard V4 only. The only V2 compatibility
families kept are auth and the browser WebSocket.

## Request Lifecycle

One inference request follows a fixed order:

1. Authenticate the client **Key** from `access_keys`.
2. Parse the client protocol and resolve an Alias, exact built-in raw ID,
   user-defined Provider public model, or eligible Custom model ID.
3. Materialize compatible accounts, then apply card order and the selected
   strict-priority, global-sticky, or round-robin policy.
4. Build one sealed adapter attempt, resolve that account's credential, and
   send one upstream request. Protocol selection uses the saved contract.
5. Convert the response or SSE stream back to the client format, then record
   request identity, upstream identity, usage, and cooldown state.

Unknown model names return `400`. Ambiguous exact raw IDs return
`ambiguous_model_id` and stay local. Account fallback may continue after
eligible pre-send or provider-specific failures; ambiguous or unsafe requests
fail before selection.

## Product Ownership

| Surface | Owns | Related surface |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Access Keys** | Client-facing primary and sub Keys | Account credentials live on **Accounts** |
| **Accounts** | Account Key, enablement, order, notes, cooldown, usage state | Catalogs and protocol contracts live on **Providers** |
| **Providers** | Built-in catalogs, model/protocol contracts, typed user-defined Provider Endpoint/auth/mappings | Custom API mappings stay on the account card |
| **Custom API account** | One API URL, one account-wide upstream protocol, public-model → upstream-ID mappings | Shared Provider definitions live on **Providers** |
| **Extensions / CPA** | A static local external-integration boundary | Built-in routing families stay under **Accounts** / **Providers** |
| **Applications / DSH** | The OCG-owned plugin installed into DSH's `web` profile | Clients use the ordinary Gateway API |

The Adapter Registry is static and sealed. User-defined Providers persist as
typed data and always bind Configurable HTTP.

## Local Model Lists

These reads use saved local state. Catalog refreshes are explicit actions on
**Providers**.

| Endpoint | Published models |
| --- | --- |
| Authenticated `GET /v1/models` | Currently qualified public names (code-owned Aliases, saved Zen/Command/CN mappings, saved user-defined Provider public models, and eligible Custom declared IDs) that carry a validated derived protocol profile from the same snapshot used to enrich the row |
| `GET /dashboard/api/v4/application-models` | Go names that resolve in the saved catalog and have an enabled protocol; it does not consult a price snapshot. Excludes Custom API, user-defined Providers, and CN Plans |

Fresh MiniMax CN, Kimi CN, and GOAT catalog rows publish unique normalized
last-segment lowercase kebab aliases from the complete saved catalog, including
IDs without `/`; saved legacy aliases remain unchanged. The legacy Nemotron
short name is retained only for an upgraded saved alias, while a fresh verbose
leaf stays verbose. Kimi rolling saved names remain unchanged, and fresh `k3`
uses `k3`. Normalization collisions and names reserved to raw-only Go rows stay
unpublished; every row retains its exact raw upstream ID. A Custom ID
that collides with a published built-in Alias is excluded from publication.

## Protocol Conversion

Clients may use OpenAI Chat Completions, OpenAI Responses, Anthropic Messages,
or Gemini `generateContent` / `streamGenerateContent` entry points. Each
attempt chooses one upstream protocol locally before the send: the saved
preferred protocol, then the enabled client protocol, then the remaining
granted protocols. The request and response are converted when that choice
differs from the client protocol. Gemini is a client format and is never an
upstream protocol. Credential and provider retries keep their existing
policy. An HTTP 400 does not switch protocol.

Selection, native opaque history, and conversion limits live in
[Protocol conversion](protocol-conversion.md).
