# Plan And API Presets

Browse Plan/API presets from **Accounts → Add account** or **Providers → Add Provider**. Both buttons open the same Accounts chooser. Existing connections list only built-in families that still have an account plus saved user-defined Providers; unused built-in templates stay with these creation templates. Presets group by vendor, with a compact selector for regional or plan variants. Search includes vendor and variant names, preset IDs and endpoint hosts. The chooser shows a read-only connection summary before the Key field. Fixed presets supply the address, protocol, authentication and an editable default model; Azure and Bedrock still require resource/regional addresses and deployment/model information. Completing a preset requires a Key and creates the Provider and its first account together; **Save draft** may omit the Key. Custom API and manual configuration retain their full settings.

Presets are build-time data, not per-vendor code: `crates/ocg-domain/build.rs` compiles `resources/provider-presets.json` into the static `PRESET_OFFERINGS` table that the dashboard renders. Adding or correcting a preset means editing that JSON; this page documents behavior, not the row contents.

Presets create ordinary user-defined Providers through the atomic Dashboard V4 onboarding commit. The saved Provider participates in account ordering, fallback, model routing and request logs. Its configuration stays editable. It does not add a separate adapter or automatically create an account before saving.

Models imported from a preset use only the last segment as the public name: `vendor/model` becomes `model`. The exact upstream ID remains `vendor/model`. Both fields can be edited. If two upstream IDs end in the same segment, choose distinct public names before saving.

On upgrade, OCG renames saved, unchanged preset-generated public names to their last segment. A mapping with a manually edited name or a conflicting last segment keeps its saved name for review. Renaming a public model changes the name clients send; update client model settings that still use the old prefixed name.

Switching presets clears the previous channel's Key and model mappings, then fills the selected channel's default model. Operator links contain no referral parameters. Discovery only changes the draft; model tests remain explicit and may be billable. Use models supporting the fixed upstream protocol. Image, audio, video and embedding-only models are outside this chat gateway's preset workflow.

Default models come from operator model documentation or request examples. They are editable starting points and do not certify account entitlement. Saving makes no upstream calls, imports no full model catalog and performs no paid test. Template updates do not rewrite saved connections; the v64 name migration above is a one-time exception.

## Discover, Test And Edit

Presets save the documented route set when you create or explicitly reapply one. Fixed presets never derive replacement paths from a runtime hostname, and updating OCG never rewrites an already saved connection. Azure and Bedrock require your resource or regional Responses URL. If that URL matches the documented Azure OpenAI or Bedrock Runtime host and path, OCG fills their other documented routes for the same resource. Review the routes before saving; a custom hostname or path stays as one manually editable route. Azure static API Keys use the `api-key` header; Microsoft Entra tokens use Bearer. Bedrock has no compatible `GET /models`, so enter its model ID yourself. Gemini's native Google API is outside these three upstream formats, so its preset uses the documented OpenAI-compatible surface.

To update a connection created from an older preset, open **Providers → Edit connection**, choose **Adopt preset protocols**, review the affected Keys and addresses, then save. Existing routes and grants are not changed just by updating OCG.

MiniMax CN/API and Global presets save distinct Chat Completions, Responses, and Messages routes. Chat and Responses use Bearer authentication; Messages uses `x-api-key`. Their full endpoints are stored so that the dashboard does not guess alternative paths. MiMo API and MiMo Token Plan (CN) similarly save Bearer-authenticated Chat `/v1/chat/completions`, Responses `/v1/responses`, and Messages `/anthropic/v1/messages` routes. See [protocol defaults](providers.md#protocol-defaults-and-connection-tests).

Fetch models only updates the draft candidate list. Empty and truncated results are shown explicitly; import only the models you select, then save. Discovery does not prove that every model accepts the selected protocol.

Choose a model and use **Test model**. The test uses its explicit protocol/endpoint override, or the supplier defaults when it inherits. A success requires a response matching the selected protocol, not just HTTP 200. It does not prove streaming, tools or other advanced features for that supplier.

Testing never changes routing or preference. **Save Provider** commits the configuration you edited. Configurable HTTP tests use the selected connection route; they do not read back or replace a saved Key. Linked platform Keys keep their managed endpoint constraints. Model protocol/endpoint overrides are connection-owned and available to both ordinary dynamic and migrated Custom HTTP connections.

The selected preset is retained when saving and reopening, including resource-specific addresses such as Azure. It preserves template hints and discovery restrictions; it does not certify an edited endpoint as official. Entries without preset provenance use only unambiguous existing configuration evidence, and manually named models are not rewritten. Changing the endpoint, Key, model or protocol clears stale test results.

## Coverage And Sources

Compared on **2026-09-08** against CC-Switch's Claude, Codex, Gemini, OpenCode, OpenClaw and Hermes [preset sources at `f3b18df`](https://github.com/farion1231/cc-switch/tree/f3b18df12007d0fd79fd8ad8d310880664015197/src/config). CC-Switch categories are discovery hints, not a trust decision: for example, Azure and xAI appear under third-party categories. The endpoint and authentication choices were checked against operator documentation.

Each preset entry is a ready configuration template, not a claim of authenticated live testing or account entitlement. Except for the matching DeepSeek/Zhipu official API presets described below, new Providers have no automatic official quota or balance synchronization. The product does not estimate a request price. Coding/Token Plan Keys and regional API Keys must match the selected endpoint; the upstream's supported-use restrictions still apply.

Protocol routes were checked against each operator's documentation on **2026-09-24**. They describe the offering's available formats, not a guarantee that every model or Key accepts each format. Tencent TokenHub, Alibaba Responses, AtlasCloud, PPIO and Novita have model-specific availability. Where an operator publishes only a base URL, the preset's full Messages URL adds the standard `/v1/messages` suffix. StreamLake's Messages proxy is pinned to the default `kat-coder-pro-v2.5` model; review the URL when changing models. Anthropic's Chat compatibility is intended for evaluation; use native Messages for full Claude features. The seeded routes are the `protocolRoutes` in the JSON, applied after you supply any customer-specific address.

The coverage below is a **capability overview**, not a row-by-row mirror. The authoritative preset list is `resources/provider-presets.json`: each entry carries its ID, display name, protocol routes, authentication scheme, operator documentation link (`docsUrl`), and editable default model. The build compiles it into `PRESET_OFFERINGS` and the in-app chooser renders it live, so this page no longer copies those fields.

**Protocol families.** Every preset speaks an OpenAI-compatible surface at minimum: Chat Completions is universal; Responses and Anthropic Messages are seeded per operator, with Messages routes authenticated by `x-api-key` or Bearer depending on the operator (each entry's `protocolRoutes` records the scheme). Most official vendor presets ship all three formats — for example DeepSeek, Kimi/Moonshot, Zhipu GLM, MiniMax, Tencent Hunyuan/TokenHub, Alibaba Bailian/QwenCloud, Volcengine Ark/Doubao, StepFun API, Xiaomi MiMo, OpenRouter, Compshare ModelVerse, and AtlasCloud — so one Key serves Chat, Responses, and Messages clients; Coding and Token Plan variants seed whichever subset of the three the operator documents for that plan. A few presets are Chat-only where that is the operator's documented surface (for example Google Gemini via its OpenAI-compatible endpoint, Z.AI GLM API, NVIDIA API Catalog, and ModelScope). Anthropic is the inverse: native Messages plus a Chat compatibility route.

**Vendor variants and brand marks.** Multi-variant vendor families (Tencent, Zhipu, Alibaba Cloud/QwenCloud, Volcengine/BytePlus, Baidu Qianfan, StepFun, Xiaomi, MiniMax, StreamLake, SiliconFlow, Compshare) stay grouped under one brand mark in the chooser. Vendor families that map to a CC0 brand asset under `src/assets/provider-logos/` (Anthropic, Google, DeepSeek, Ollama, NVIDIA, OpenRouter, Alibaba Cloud, ByteDance, Baidu) render that logo; the rest use a tinted monogram block carrying the vendor's initial. The built-in plans Kimi Code CN, MiniMax CN, and Ollama Cloud also show their vendor brand marks even though they live outside the chooser.

**Customer-supplied addresses.** Azure OpenAI v1 and AWS Bedrock stay template-only until you enter your resource or regional URL; their presets describe the documented route sets for that address.

**Balance panels.** Only the DeepSeek API and Zhipu GLM API presets carry the official balance behavior described below; other presets have no official quota or balance synchronization. None of these presets shows a price table.

**StepFun credits.** Step Plan (CN) keeps a manual credit balance. See the StepFun section below.

KAT-Coder's full Chat URL and Bearer auth are derived from its official OpenAI-compatible client configuration (base URL plus the standard `/chat/completions` suffix). Its Messages URL adds `/v1/messages` to the documented Claude proxy base. Coding Plan use is subject to [StreamLake's subscription terms](https://www.streamlake.ai/document/DOC/mjzrrkirccgntfkz46). Ant Ling uses the current official `api.ant-ling.com` domain.

**Unverified gap:** CC-Switch's Baidu personal Token Plan `/v2/tokenplan/personal` route could not be corroborated in the fetched official docs. It is not offered as a preset. The documented Qianfan general API, legacy Coding Plan and team Token Plan are included separately; do not use a personal Key on the team endpoint.

## Existing Integrations And Exclusions

- **OpenCode Go**, **Kimi Code CN** and **MiniMax CN Token Plan** retain their existing built-in routing and usage behavior. Select those existing Providers for the subscription workflow; the Moonshot and MiniMax API presets cover the distinct API/region use cases.
- Azure uses the current v1 API with a resource URL and deployment name. It does not provision resources or refresh Entra ID tokens. Bedrock uses its official OpenAI-compatible API with an API Key; AWS AK/SK signing is not implemented.
- New API / One API / Sub2API distributors, subscription reverse proxies, referral-only relay listings and providers whose operator/API provenance could not be established are not included. A CC-Switch “aggregator” label alone is insufficient.
- The included aggregation/inference platforms have their own documented service: OpenRouter, SiliconFlow, NVIDIA, ModelScope, PPIO, Qiniu, Novita, Compshare and AtlasCloud. This is a selected set, not a blanket import of CC-Switch's relay catalog.
- Browser subscription login, GitHub Copilot OAuth, Codex OAuth and Grok OAuth are not API Key presets. Existing CPA integration is separate.

Initial model IDs are reviewed against operator documentation rather than copied from CC-Switch. You can replace or extend them using the current catalog or console, retaining exact upstream spelling. A missing model-list interface does not prevent saving an explicit mapping.

## Official API Balances

DeepSeek API and Zhipu GLM API presets can show an official balance when their saved preset, API offering, authentication, and official destination still match. Inference remains on Configurable HTTP. This balance reader is not available for arbitrary Custom API endpoints, edited proxy destinations, or Coding Plan presets. There is no reference-price panel and no price refresh.

On **Accounts**, the card shows the observed remaining balance. It is not a quota bar, and it is not a price-based monthly or lifetime spend. A missing balance stays unavailable and is not shown as 0. DeepSeek's **Refresh balance** reads the selected Key's official `/user/balance`. The remaining figure is the official total; a gift caption appears only when granted credit is above zero (it is already inside the total). Balance refresh never changes enablement, authentication, cooldown, or routing, and errors keep the last successful observation. A replaced Key or edited endpoint cannot inherit an old balance. Zhipu shows that no public balance API is integrated; it does not invent a wallet value or request undocumented console endpoints.

The gateway does not fetch a price list or estimate a new request from stored reference rates. A cost that was not recorded stays unknown and is not shown as zero or free. Older stored prices stay on disk and are not recalculated. A CNY balance is not converted into a USD cost, and a balance reading does not debit the wallet. Editing a model's route to another destination cannot inherit an official balance.

## StepFun API (CN) Balance And Step Plan (CN) Credits

StepFun API (CN) ordinary endpoints on `api.stepfun.com` (not the `/step_plan` path) can refresh a Key-authenticated current balance with the same Accounts balance reading used for DeepSeek and Moonshot. That official wallet is unchanged. A missing balance stays unavailable and is not shown as 0.

Step Plan (CN) has no official usage API in Open Console Gateway. The account card keeps a manual credit balance. A Step preset is an amount and a monthly renewal, not a token rate. Buckets, grants, monthly renewal, and expiry stay separate, and **Calibrate usage** corrects the saved balance by hand. A completed request does not reduce that balance. The product does not ask for per-token rates or a currency conversion. A missing amount stays unknown and is not recorded as zero or free. An empty or unknown balance does not stop routing. Remaining does not include an expired grant, and the card does not invent one shared reset. No console cookie or login is required.

Configurable HTTP destinations can keep the same manual credit balance. Open Console Gateway does not fetch a rate document for it.
