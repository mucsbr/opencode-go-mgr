# Accounts

The list loads a page of saved account summaries from the local Rust core.
Search and filters cover the complete inventory; totals and card availability
also cover every Key, including rows on other pages. Use the paging controls
to see more rows. Editors, billing details, platform models and arrangement
load their complete data when opened. Changing pages does not change routing
order. Revisiting keeps visible content while revalidating it.

Available credential operations, model-test choices and quota editing windows
come from the local gateway. A confirmed manual quota edit stays visible if
the following refresh fails. Wallet totals and monthly usage with different
units are not displayed under one currency label; a missing value stays unknown.

Edit Custom API endpoints, protocols, and model mappings on the account, even
when it has multiple Keys. For a user-defined HTTP Provider, edit these in
**Providers**, even if it has only one Key. Only Plans with a modeled
subscription period display expiry; CPA and user-defined API/Plan presets do
not.

Choose **Account routing** from the dropdown above the account list and use the adjacent **Conversation sticky** switch. Each change saves immediately; a successful change resets runtime routing state. Hover or focus the question-mark buttons for explanations.

- **Routing mode** — strict priority, global sticky, or round robin. All three
  modes apply the one global card order only after filtering incompatible,
  disabled, cooling, or already-failed cards. Only one base mode is active at
  a time.
- **Conversation sticky** — an overlay switch, not a fourth routing mode.
  When on, the gateway prefers the `X-OCG-Conversation-Id` request header;
  without it, it uses a prompt fingerprint (system / tools / first user
  message). If no conversation key can be built, the base routing mode is
  used. Similar prompts may share a binding.

**Add account** first distinguishes an existing connection from a new service.
Existing connections use the same projection as **Providers**: built-in
Providers that still have at least one account, and every saved user-defined
Provider (with or without a Key). Deleting the last account of a built-in
family removes it from existing connections and returns it to the new-service
templates.

Choose an existing connection to add another Key using its saved address,
protocol, and models. Choose a new service to browse unused built-in
templates, Plan/API presets, Custom API, or a platform site; saving a preset
creates a Provider and its first account together.

**Providers → Add Provider** opens this same chooser. Saving a preset from
**Add account** uses the same onboarding commit as **Providers**. Connection
summaries remain visible before entering a Key. Regional variants use a
compact picker. Keys are stored by the account service; you can add one here
or from a Provider's detail with **Add Key**.

Provider choices come from the V4 destination and catalog projection; the
chooser lists them by name, with Custom API first when adding a new service.
`provider_id` is the chooser, filter, dialog, and cache key. A successful
empty catalog stays empty. If the catalog cannot be loaded, only the OpenCode
Go creation form remains available; an existing Zen Free singleton can still
be displayed, while every other built-in, Custom, and user-defined entry
fails closed. Names, offering types, creation status, and form fields come
from each catalog row. The chooser has no Plan/API sections.

After the first ready account for a sealed Provider is saved, the dashboard
consults that Provider's existing contract capability before refreshing its
model catalog; another Key does not refresh again. A capability or refresh
failure never rolls back the saved account and can be retried from
**Providers → Refresh model catalog**.

**Enabled** means the account may enter routing. New ready Key accounts, including Custom API and user-defined Providers, start enabled. Test connection does not change the switch. Already-enabled or disabled accounts stay as stored. Test results stay in the test dialog. User-defined Providers have no modeled subscription period, including those created from Plan presets: their accounts do not show an inferred purchase date, expiry countdown, or expiry alert. Existing stored purchase anchors are preserved for compatibility, but are not presented as confirmed billing facts.

Accounts edit through the same forms used to create them. Ready, routable cards show enabled, disabled, cooling, quota exhausted, or unavailable. Dynamic, Custom and CPA accounts do not display an inferred subscription period, even when compatibility data contains a purchase date.

Confirmed quota exhaustion dims that Key and skips routing. Enabled stays as stored. Disabling a Key dims that row immediately. The card itself is gray only when every Key on it is dimmed (disabled, invalid, cooling, quota-exhausted, or otherwise not routeable). When every Key on the card is quota-exhausted, the card is labeled quota exhausted. A mix of disabled, invalid, and quota-exhausted Keys shows no available Key. An empty card shows no Key. Each presentation card is judged on its own rows. New exhaustion is established only by authoritative official Go usage; historical episodes remain until recovery or Key replacement.

A ready Key row can **Rotate Key**, **Add Key**, and **Edit binding** from the overflow menu. Rotate replaces only the Key this console will send on later requests for that card's credential (same credential id; version numbers increase). It is a local replacement: the provider-side credential is not revoked and stays under your control. Rotating or otherwise replacing a Key clears local state tied to the old Key version. **Add Key** creates another inference Key on that connection only when the server allows credential creation for that connection and accepts the submitted material kind; the shared backend guard returns its reason when it refuses. Quota is independent unless you explicitly share with a selected inference Key on the same identity; using one connection or identity is not enough. After save, cards that actually share a stored quota pool show that relationship (naming the sibling Key when possible). A third Key stays independent when it has its own pool or none. Configurable HTTP connections, including migrated Custom API records, support multiple Keys. Zen Free, CPA, no-auth, and observer credentials remain singletons or externally owned and do not expose Add Key. The CPA pool card also shows whether an OCG-managed runtime is running, stopped, not installed, or in an install/start phase; an external CPA connection is labeled as such and does not report a process OCG does not own. A running or external pool stays a normal available card; a stopped, missing, or failed managed runtime grays the card without flipping Enabled. If create does not return a definite result, the form keeps the submitted contents and operation: retry the same body, or cancel; do not change the form and submit again (that can create a duplicate Key).

Edit binding changes that credential's enabled state, model scope (all models, or only the exact names you list), and — when you change it — destination consent: which configured endpoint this Key may be sent to (protocol and URL). The current endpoint is resolved from this exact credential's saved grants; a sibling Key never lends an Origin. If a provider URL later changes, the saved Origin is shown and that endpoint stays unchecked until you explicitly allow the new destination. Changing only scope or enabled leaves destinations unchanged. Clearing both destination lists revokes access. Sealed official endpoints with no URL stay locked destinations and do not invent Origin strings. A disabled binding is shown on that card and does not flip the account enable switch. Zen Free, CPA, no-auth, and observer credentials do not expose rotate or binding. An identity can hold more than one Key; each account row uses the credential whose legacy account id matches that row.

Accounts are arranged in supplier cards. A card can contain several accounts / Keys, and one supplier can have several cards sharing its address, protocols and models. Moving an account preserves its credential, grants, usage, quota pool, cooldown, saved GOAT plan deadlines, and local state. Provider and Plan remain one product identity (`provider_id` only). OpenCode Go counts usage by account **Key**, Zen Free shares free cooldown by egress IP, and Custom API keeps no provider-side quota. Card order, then row order inside each card, defines the persisted routing priority used by strict priority, global sticky and round-robin after eligibility filtering. There is no per-model quota pool. Ordinary cooldown can fan out through a **declared quota pool**; a `429` cooldown remains on its receiving Key.

**Accounts** owns identity, the account **Key**, verification, enabled state,
card order, managed registration, and available usage / cooldown /
quota-recovery state. Catalogs, protocol probes, per-model protocol
overrides, and configurable HTTP Endpoint/auth/protocol/mappings live on
**Providers**.

An account stores one Key (when auth requires it), notes, enablement, model
scope, grants, quota relation, and runtime state. No-auth connections expose
one singleton credential and reject a second.

Quota cards follow catalog capabilities instead of Provider IDs.
`usageAvailability=available` loads Provider quota windows and enables the
refresh action. `manualUsageCalibration=true` additionally loads the local
calibration object for editing, while the card itself still renders the
Provider windows. OpenCode Go, GOAT, and Ollama set that flag. Go edits the
5-hour, weekly, and monthly windows. Ollama edits the month window, including
before a tier is chosen, and does not accept a week percentage. Zen, MiniMax,
Kimi, Custom, and CPA do not show the editor. Metadata that explicitly turns
manual calibration off also hides it. A missing, blank, or null percentage is
not saved as 0. Other rows show no quota strip; Zen Free keeps its separate
egress cooldown. Known MiniMax/Kimi window names remain friendly, and unknown
window names are humanized without changing stored wire values.

Custom API and user-defined Provider cards whose stored Endpoint host is exactly `api.deepseek.com`, `api.moonshot.cn`, or `api.moonshot.ai` can also **Refresh quota** to read that official current balance. DeepSeek and Zhipu official API cards show the observed remaining balance. It is not a quota bar, and it is not a price-based monthly or lifetime spend. A New API / Sub2API parent card shows the site's Balance, This month, and Lifetime from the site wallet and consume log. Those three figures are not a local price and not a request cost. A missing balance stays unavailable and is not shown as 0. Known-host official balances keep a remaining figure. **Refresh quota** on ordinary quota/balance accounts completes independently of model discovery. Use the row menu’s **Refresh model catalog** for the official Provider catalog or Custom / known-host `/v1/models` discovery. Model-only accounts keep their manual model-refresh fallback; platform Keys keep their existing platform synchronization.

Built-in catalog rows follow each Provider's documented default policy; GOAT's first snapshot starts only its plan-included models on. Usage snapshots stay display-only: a bar at 100%, unknown, or failed never marks a Key exhausted and never changes routing. Other Custom destinations have no balance endpoint in this product.
Account rows and saved quota snapshots load independently of catalog metadata. Same-session, same-binding snapshots remain visible while revalidating, including after a failed upstream refresh. Ordinary quota observations share a pool of at most four requests and publish per account; a slow account does not block completed peers. Duplicate requests for one account share completion, and queued manual requests take priority over background requests. Platform synchronization and model catalog writes remain exclusive to preserve CAS. Automatic refresh still runs only while the Accounts page is active and visible, respects freshness and server retry deadlines, and reconciles the destination projection once per pass. It is not a new server-wide background poller.

GOAT cards offer **Refresh quota** to read the official 5-hour, weekly, and monthly windows. When that reading includes a percentage, the window uses it against a full window of 100 and keeps its reset. The endpoint is used by the official CLI but is not documented in the public Provider API. Later requests do not add a price onto the percentage, and a dollar amount is not relabeled as a percentage. You can save a manual percentage. With no official reading and no manual percentage, the window stays unavailable and is not shown as 0. The monthly reset still uses the configured purchase date when the upstream does not provide one. Ollama Cloud exposes no official usage API in this product and does not estimate a monthly credit meter from request prices. The account form still presents Pro, Max, or Team and a purchase date. A manual percentage does not require a price. A month percentage can be saved before a tier is chosen. A week percentage is not accepted. Without an official or manual usage observation, usage stays unavailable. Existing accounts remain routeable. Previously stored billing rows stay on disk and are not recalculated.

The Adapter Registry is sealed. Built-in Provider families are:

| Family | Provider ID | Live routing | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OpenCode Go | `opencode` | Yes | One officially distributable API Key per account; managed signup remains Beta |
| Zen Free | `opencode-zen-free` | Yes | One credentialless, anonymous singleton; sortable and enableable, not deletable; quota shared by egress IP |
| Command Code GOAT | `command-code` | Yes | Public Provider catalog; the first snapshot starts only GOAT plan models on. Models first discovered later default on with documented endpoints. Saved switches persist; models with no protocol evidence wait for official documentation. No account-level GOAT/All or Max mode. |
| MiniMax CN Token Plan | `minimax` | Yes | Dedicated `sk-cp` Key; fixed official Chat, Responses, and Messages routes, authenticated model directory, and manual official Token Plan usage refresh |
| Kimi Code CN | `kimi` | Yes | Dedicated Kimi Code Key; fixed official Chat and Messages routes, authenticated model directory, and manual official weekly/rate-window usage refresh |
| Ollama Cloud | `ollama` | Yes | Fixed-origin Chat Completions only (`https://ollama.com`, Bearer); public keyless catalog refresh. No official usage API in this product, and no monthly credit meter estimated from request prices. The form still presents Pro, Max, or Team and a purchase date. A manual percentage does not require a price. A month percentage can be saved before a tier is chosen. A week percentage is not accepted. Without an official or manual usage observation, usage stays unavailable. Existing accounts stay routeable |
| Custom API | `custom` | Yes | Compatibility identity for migrated configurable HTTP connections; one connection owns its API URL, auth, protocol, and public-name → upstream-ID mappings, while multiple Key accounts may attach; existing records remain separate and retain public-name-only resolution; request cost stays unknown and is not shown as zero or free; a manual credit balance is not deducted from the request |

Configurable HTTP connections and individual models have separate **Enabled** switches in **Providers → Edit connection**. Renaming a connection or editing mappings preserves existing disabled models. Deleting the final Key preserves the connection and its model settings.

## Manual Credit Balance

Custom API and saved configurable HTTP accounts can keep a manual credit balance. Buckets, grants, monthly renewal, and expiry stay separate, and you can correct the saved balance by hand. The fields you set are the name, currency, monthly amount, and source URL. The product does not ask for per-token rates or a currency conversion, and a completed request does not reduce the balance.

A missing figure stays unknown. It is not shown as zero or free. Opening the dashboard, exporting, or sending a request does not recalculate stored balances or old receipts. Only an explicit manual change updates the balance. An empty or unknown balance does not disable routing.

New API / Sub2API site Keys and sealed built-in Plans keep their observed billing views. Editing a Key keeps an existing manual balance. If the Key save is confirmed and a later read fails, the Key stays saved; read it again instead of creating another. See [Upgrade and backup](upgrade-backup.md).

## Move A Node Configuration

Supplier and model enablement, enabled protocols and preferred protocols are restored from matching source records. Target-only models remain; conflicting upstream mappings or route overrides reject the entire import. No-auth HTTP destinations can also be exported and restored.

Use **Export** on the Accounts toolbar to create a password-encrypted
`.ocgbackup` file, then use **Import** on the destination node to preview and
confirm the merge. Choose a migration password of at least 12 characters and
transfer it separately from the file; Open Console Gateway cannot recover it.
The operation remains available only from the node's loopback dashboard;
forwarded scheme headers do not grant access to a remote dashboard.

The current payload moves destinations and credentials as the authority
(ready Keys, platform and CPA observer management credentials, and identity /
grant / cooldown extras stay inside the encrypted envelope), Custom
Endpoint/public-model → upstream-ID mappings and verification state encoded on
those entities, user-defined Providers as destination extras, the primary and
active sub Access Keys, portable routing/proxy settings, Zen Free
enablement/catalog, Provider catalogs, evidence, protocol overrides, and
explicit HTTP protocol routes, plus quota-pool membership.

Shared identities, a second credential on the same identity, binding model
restrictions and enabled flags, and quota-pool membership and declared/unknown
evidence are restored as stored. V7 Custom destinations are normalized to the
connection-owned multi-Key representation without changing their stable IDs or
public-name-only lookup behavior. Matching stable IDs are merged with
package-owned portable fields; same-Plan or same-name rows with different IDs
coexist and independent same-URL accounts are not merged. Existing destination
accounts keep their current order and position; source-only accounts append in
package order. Destination-only Access Keys and Provider scopes are retained.
A merge that omits a CPA observer key keeps the destination's existing
management key.

Browser profiles/cookies, third-party login passwords, referral codes, logs,
and usage history do not move. Local quota-recovery state is not exported. An
import that leaves the target Key unchanged keeps that local recovery;
replacing the Key clears it. V9 carries source cooldown deadlines without
shortening a later destination deadline; V4/V5 keep cooldown behavior
host-local. Existing destination usage history and browser data stay in place;
stale authentication and last-error flags are cleared when package account
fields replace the stored credential.

Machine-local listener/root URL, auto-start, and Dock settings also stay with
the destination. Ready managed accounts keep their Key, but their browser
login does not move; unfinished managed drafts are skipped. Import accepts
payload V4 through the current export version. Pre-V11 packages remain
compatible when they omit protocol routes; a pre-V11 package carrying
nonempty explicit routes is rejected rather than losing those routes. The current export stores each GOAT Key's plan-window map separately from ordinary cooldowns. A V4–V11 import is ordinary-only: the same Key keeps deadlines already on this node, and a changed Key drops them. A current export of the same Key merges the later deadline in each window; a changed Key drops the old deadlines, then applies a valid incoming map. Same-Key preservation keeps or merges that map only while the incoming credential is still GOAT; moving the same id and the same plaintext to a non-GOAT provider, including Custom HTTP, remains a supported remap and discards only the GOAT map while ordinary cooldowns stay. A pre-V12 file that carries the field is rejected. V4/V5
packages rebuild one identity, credential, All-scope binding, and identity
quota pool per account. Payloads older than V4 or newer than the current
export version are rejected with an explicit unsupported-version error. A
V4/V5 file that already contains V6 identity fields, or a V6 file that already
contains V7 destination fields, is rejected rather than silently dropping
them. The outer encrypted envelope remains version 1 and is distinct from the
portable payload version. The current payload version is listed in
[Upgrade and backup](upgrade-backup.md).

Every persistent mutation path rejects `enabled=true` for a catalogued
`routable=false` Provider before it mutates the row, revision, or timestamps.
GOAT catalog refresh updates the model directory; Key auth is observed from
inference 401/403. An enabled, ready account with a non-empty Key can route
models enabled in the Provider matrix. A newly created, routable Custom API
account starts enabled. Editing the Endpoint, capabilities, Key, or
protocol preserves its enabled state. Disabled drafts remain saveable. Saving
the first ready account for a refreshable built-in Provider also runs that
Provider's **Refresh model catalog** once. Adding another Key to an existing
connection does not. The account is created even if the refresh fails.

Use only the official provider API **Key** for OpenCode Go, Command Code GOAT,
MiniMax Token Plan, or Kimi Code. Browser cookies and reverse-proxy credentials
are not account Keys. GOAT is a separate provider mapping and its Key is sent
only to fixed Command Code inference and account-usage endpoints, never to
OpenCode; the public catalog refresh remains keyless. Custom API is a
separate trusted-administrator destination and must not send its key to an
OpenCode endpoint.

MiniMax and Kimi keys are also origin-bound: sealed MiniMax CN inference and catalog routes use
`https://api.minimax.cn/v1` plus the documented `/anthropic` route; its older usage endpoint is unchanged. Kimi Code CN uses
`https://api.kimi.com/coding/v1`. Model and usage refreshes are explicit
dashboard actions. Usage display never changes routing eligibility. Before the
first successful usage refresh, the account card still shows a neutral **Not
yet refreshed** quota bar; official windows replace it after refresh.

Command Code's official `GET /models` is public and refreshes one
Provider-level catalog. **Refresh quota** on the account card also runs that
catalog refresh. The Providers matrix remains the model-supply control: GOAT
plan-included rows start on in the first catalog snapshot. Other rows in that
snapshot start off; models first discovered in later refreshes default on with
documented supported endpoints. Saved switches persist, and models without
protocol evidence wait for official documentation.

Custom API is a live trusted-administrator destination. **Providers** edits its mappings: each row pairs a public model name (what the client requests) with the exact upstream model ID (what OCG sends). A connection stores either its legacy route or one to three explicit Chat Completions, Responses, and/or Messages routes, each with its endpoint and authentication. Each mapping inherits the route for its protocol unless it has a single explicit upstream override. **Accounts** edits only attached Keys and bindings. Existing complete endpoints remain exact. **Fetch models** uses the saved directory route; non-standard routes remain exact for inference and retain manual model entry instead of guessing a directory URL. Discovery returns upstream IDs only. Choosing one imports a row with the public name and upstream ID exactly equal. Fetching does not save, verify, enable, or grant a Key.

A trusted administrator may configure a public, LAN, or loopback HTTP or HTTPS
origin. Metadata, link-local, and opaque IPv4-trick hosts (for example
`169.254.169.254` or `metadata.google.internal`) are rejected. URL-embedded
credentials, query strings, and fragments are rejected. The gateway
rejects redirects and does not forward dashboard or client authentication.
A model or endpoint override to another Origin does not inherit the stored Key.
Each configurable HTTP route sends the authentication header saved for that route:
`Authorization: Bearer <key>`, `x-api-key: <key>`, or `api-key: <key>`.
A 401 does not retry with a different auth header. Root and
`/v1` bases resolve through the same rule for discovery, verification, and
production inference; legacy complete Endpoints are requested verbatim.
Custom HTTP uses the same process-wide Direct / Manual / Auto proxy policy;
connect and request timeouts are bounded from the configured connect timeout
(clamped 5–60 seconds).

Every ready account card has the same **Test connection** action. It opens an
account-scoped, searchable model table with single-model and sequential
**Test all** controls. Each test sends one minimal real request through that
exact account and its current effective protocol. Tests stay on that account:
they do not switch accounts, run gateway fallback, change enablement,
cooldown or quota recovery, or write Provider protocol evidence. They are
not the quota-recovery trial. Results live only in the open
dialog; closing it stops dispatching queued tests. A request already sent may finish, and testing
may consume provider quota. Provider-page tests remain the separate,
low-frequency control for validating newly added Provider model/protocol
capabilities and may use eligible-account fallback.

Eligible accounts (enabled + ready + non-empty key) expose only their routeable
public names on authenticated `GET /v1/models`. A Custom public name resolves
to its paired exact upstream ID. A public name never steals a published
built-in Alias. Raw identity
conflicts are excluded from publication and resolve as `ambiguous_model_id`
without an upstream call. Undeclared names stay unknown (`400`). Changing the
Endpoint, Key, mappings, or protocol leaves the account enabled. Endpoint and
upstream protocol can be edited after create; the config and complete mapping
set are replaced in one CAS transaction. Disabling the declared protocol makes
the model unroutable; no fixed-priority fallback or override can enable an
undeclared protocol. Custom traffic does not get a local price. A missing cost stays unknown and is not shown as zero or free. A manual credit balance is not deducted from the request, and Custom has no provider usage refresh. `MODEL_PROTOCOLS` is Go-specific; Custom
converts the client protocol to the account's single upstream protocol.

Use the existing-connection choices to add another Key without creating a second Provider. New-service choices contain unused built-in templates, Plan/API presets, Custom API and platform types. Search matches vendor, variant, preset name and endpoint host. Selecting a result retains its exact variant when the search clears. Zen Free is a backend-owned singleton, managed only from the account list; OpenCode Go offers its optional managed-registration action where the host supports it.

- A **Key account** stores one officially distributable OpenCode Go API key.
- A **managed account** immediately creates a disabled, recoverable draft, then
  runs the wizard through optional sign-in identity, invite registration,
  payment, and key verification. The draft and current step are persisted to
  SQLite, so closing the page or restarting the service does not lose the flow.
  Pending accounts cannot be selected by the gateway and do not expose usage,
  verify, or enable controls.

Managed signup and isolated browser profiles are **Beta** features. They have
not been thoroughly tested; do not rely on them in production.

When you create a managed draft, the form shows the **invite URL** (prefilled
from the OpenCode Go provider; fresh installs may ship a demo default). Edit it
in place: it must be an HTTPS URL no longer than 2,048 characters, contain no
username or password, and use exactly `opencode.ai` or `console.opencode.ai` as
its host. If it differs from the saved value, it is written back to
**Providers → OpenCode Go → Settings**. Changes affect later invite-page opens
only; they do not rewrite completed accounts. Replace the demo default with your
own invite link before a real signup, or referral credit goes to the link owner.

The managed wizard is intentionally manual (no password autofill, no payment
clicks, no automatic key extraction):

1. **Sign-in identity (optional).** Sign up for Google or GitHub only if you
   need a new account; otherwise **skip this step**. OpenCode sign-in can also
   finish on the next step.
2. **Invite registration.** Open the invite URL in the same isolated profile and
   complete OpenCode sign-in/registration with Google or GitHub.
3. **Payment.** Confirm the plan and amount in the console; only you complete
   payment on the page.
4. **Verify Key.** Copy the key from the console, paste it, and run a real
   upstream probe.

Click an earlier finished step in the step bar to **rewind**; forward progress
still uses each step's primary button. A `2xx` verification completes and enables
the account. A `429` also proves that the key is valid, completes the account,
and records the current cooldown. `401`/`403`, network errors, and `5xx`
responses leave the account at key verification so you can correct it and retry.

Every account has a durable, isolated browser profile. Desktop builds launch an
external Chromium-family browser: Windows prefers Edge and then Chrome; macOS
checks Chrome, Edge, and Chromium; Linux desktop searches `PATH` for Chrome,
Chromium, or Edge. It uses only `browser-profiles/<account_id>`, first-run
suppression, and a new window; it does not enable CDP, automation,
`--no-sandbox`, or weakened web security.

Every ready OpenCode Go account offers **Open OpenCode console**
(`https://opencode.ai/auth`). The profile starts blank the first time; sign in
once and its cookies remain available.
Google/GitHub and OpenCode cookies belong to different domains, but both stay in
the same account profile.

Resetting browser identity first closes that account's browser and removes both
new and legacy profile directories. A completed account keeps its key and is only
signed out of the console; a pending managed account also returns to the sign-in
identity step. Deleting an account likewise deletes its cookies/profile, and the
confirmation states this explicitly. That login state can then be recovered only
from a backup or by signing in again.

Each ready OpenCode Go or GOAT card shows the account name, cooldown state, and 5-hour / weekly / monthly usage windows. OpenCode Go periodically replaces those windows with the official percentage and reset. GOAT does that only when you click **Refresh quota**. Later requests do not add a price onto the percentage. Zen Free has its own anonymous, egress-IP-shared free cooldown rather than a key quota.

- **Usage baselines.** Type a percentage or drag a bar to save the current usage for that window. The saved percentage stays until the next official refresh or the next manual save. Request prices are not added on top. Reaching 100% is still only a warning; it does not stop the gateway from selecting the account. The control appears only when that Plan allows manual calibration. A window with no official reading and no saved percentage stays unavailable and is not shown as 0. The first saved percentage is only that quota window. Opening the page again, or reading it again while it stays open, shows that percentage and does not fill in a full billing status. A manual credit balance, a cash balance, and a platform site's observed consumption history stay separate.
- **Refresh quota (ready Key and managed accounts).** The existing OpenCode Go scheduler continues to replace the windows from `/zen/go/v1/usage` on its established cadence; no new global polling loop is added. **Refresh quota** uses the same throttled, concurrently coalesced path on demand. A real `429` starts the temporary Key cooldown immediately and can queue that same asynchronous refresh without making the client request wait. Fetched Go usage may establish or clear Go quota state. A failed, rate-limited, or unsupported refresh keeps the previous observation or unknown and never writes inference cooldown or `auth_error`. The request uses the same global outbound proxy as other dashboard fetches.
- **Refresh GOAT quota.** The GOAT card calls the fixed first-party `https://api.commandcode.ai/alpha/billing/credits` endpoint with that account's Key only after an explicit click. When the reading includes a percentage, the 5-hour, weekly, and monthly windows use that percentage against 100. This path has the same 15-second per-account throttle and global proxy, but no automatic schedule; its result never writes inference cooldown or the saved plan deadlines, and it does not change routing. You can still save a manual percentage. A missing reading stays unavailable and is not shown as 0.
- **GOAT inference restrictions.** An unrecognized `429` starts the same 30-second
  temporary Key cooldown, extended but never shortened by valid `Retry-After`.
  The exact plan-limit sentence — HTTP 429, `error.code` `RATE_LIMITED`,
  `error.type` `rate_limit_error`, and the complete sentence in
  [Routing](routing.md) — stores the declared 5-hour, weekly, or monthly reset
  on the receiving Key only. Each window keeps the later time. That deadline
  is not a pool cooldown and is not quota recovery. A longer `Retry-After`
  waits in memory on that Key, is not saved as the plan reset, is not part of
  a node export, and an unrelated catalog refresh does not drop it. A shorter
  declared reset is not raised to 30 seconds. The Key is eligible again when
  the latest active deadline passes. Saving the same Key keeps the deadlines.
  Replacing the Key clears them, then applies a valid map from an incoming
  file. Moving the Key to another card of the same supplier keeps them. A
  manual cooldown reset clears them and fences a response already in flight.
  The quota-recovery **Retry** action only marks that recovery eligible and
  leaves the deadlines in place. This fork also saves a month deadline for the
  observed insufficient-credits `400` when the saved purchase date yields a
  future natural-month renewal within 32 days. That deadline comes from local
  purchase-date policy, not an upstream reset. Without a usable date, the
  existing 30–300-second Key-and-model wait remains. Other GOAT error text,
  caps, and displayed usage do not create
  or clear permanent quota state.
- **Identity and credentials.** The name is the account's required primary
  display label. The login account field is optional; on Key-account creation,
  entering it first copies it into the name until you edit the name yourself.
  Optional freeform notes live in **Edit account**. They can stay empty and do
  not affect routing or quota. The dashboard stores the account key but does not
  collect or manage third-party login passwords.
- **Purchase date.** New lifecycle-bearing accounts default to the browser's
  current date. Click the expiry tag on a card to choose another purchase date
  or set it directly to today; the full edit form remains available. The managed
  wizard also writes the purchase date when
  payment advances to key verification. That date change, and the wizard's
  write, do not clear a previously stored monthly usage cost offset. Expiry is the same day in the next
  natural month, clamped to that month's last day when necessary:
  `2026-01-31` expires on `2026-02-28`. Accounts and Dashboard show days
  remaining, due today, or days expired. This is informational only and never
  disables an account or prevents the gateway from selecting it. Zen Free and
  Custom API have no purchase-cycle expiry and show no expiry tag or alert.
- **Priority order.** Reorder cards and the accounts inside them directly. Move a whole card, reorder its rows, or move a Key to another card of the same supplier. To arrange `A1 → B1 → A2`, create another A card and move A2 into it. Pointer and keyboard controls save the same order. Sorting is disabled while filters are active so hidden accounts keep their positions. Empty cards and adjacent cards of the same supplier remain separate.
- **Card folding and sort mode.** Each card header chevron folds the card to a one-line summary (Key count and enabled count); folding is view-only state saved in this browser across page reloads. A card's overflow menu also offers **Move up**, **Move down**, **Move to top**, and **Move to bottom**, saved through the same full-layout write as dragging. The toolbar **Reorder** toggle switches the list to a compact sort mode: the filters are bypassed and disabled so every card and Key stays visible as a single draggable line, and **Done** exits, restoring the previous filters and folded cards.
- **Cooldown reset.** You can reset an ordinary cooldown manually from this view. On the selected Key this also clears that Key's saved GOAT plan deadlines and fences a response already in flight. A sibling Key's deadlines stay. The bar shows the official or saved manual percentage again as soon as the cooldown is cleared. A window with no such percentage stays unavailable and is not shown as 0.
- **429 cooldown.** An unrecognized `429` cools its exact Key for 30 seconds unless a valid
  `Retry-After` produces a later deadline. The exact GOAT plan-limit sentence uses that Key's declared reset instead; see the GOAT bullet above. It does not spread to a quota-pool
  sibling, and no background probe is sent when it becomes eligible. Retained
  historical quota state is not bulk-purged; fetched authoritative Go usage is
  the path that can reconcile Go state.
