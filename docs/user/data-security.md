# Data And Security

Open Console Gateway stores your keys, passwords, and browser sessions on the
local disk. Protect the data directory: there is no remote recovery if it is
lost.

- **GUI data location.** Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.ocg-mgr`. macOS / Linux:
  `~/.ocg-mgr`. CLI data defaults to `~/.ocg-mgr-cli` on every platform and
  can be overridden with `--data-dir <path>`.
- **Credential storage.** Account keys and saved login passwords are stored
  with AES-256-GCM (`v2:` ciphertext) derived from the Host cipher seed.
  Older XOR-obfuscated rows still decrypt so a directory backup remains
  restorable; a successful open rewrites them to v2. This is still a
  local-disk bound, not a remote KMS: anyone with the data directory and its
  `.encryption-key`, or able to run the Windows GUI in the original Windows
  user/machine context, can recover account keys and saved login passwords.
  Dashboard Access Keys live in the `access_keys` table. The macOS / Linux
  GUI and the CLI also place a `.encryption-key` file inside the data
  directory; **back it up with the database** because losing it makes stored
  credentials unreadable. The dashboard SPA never writes Key plaintext to
  `localStorage`; Connection Center secrets stay in memory until logout or
  401. Probe and repair errors do not print plaintext Keys.
- **Browser profiles.** `browser-profiles/`, or Docker's
  `ocg-browser-profiles`, contains long-lived cookies and official-site login
  state and is not encrypted by Open Console Gateway at all. Protect,
  transfer, and destroy it with the same care as the database and account
  keys.
- **Portable node backup.** Each node manages its own accounts through its own
  dashboard. Move portable node state with a password-encrypted `.ocgbackup`
  file from the loopback dashboard; no separate administrator step-up is
  required. Account and Access Keys are encrypted with Argon2id plus
  AES-256-GCM. The migration password is not stored and cannot be recovered.
  Treat the file and password as separate secrets. Exports use the current
  payload and imports accept V4 through the current export version (V4/V5 keep
  their older host-local cooldown behavior); see
  [Upgrade and backup](upgrade-backup.md). V7 began preserving destinations,
  credentials, identity grouping, credential and binding IDs, model
  restrictions, quota-pool relationships, and cooldown deadlines, and import
  never shortens a later destination cooldown. From V10 the payload also
  carries each account's stored credit configuration. Import keeps that
  history, including legacy rates, and does not reprice it or settle an old
  pending receipt. The monthly expiry, expired buckets, configuration,
  counters, and monthly cursor stay exact. Binding and meter ids are new. The
  configuration you edit is the name, currency, monthly amount, and source
  URL. V11 adds explicit HTTP protocol routes — a pre-V11 package carrying
  nonempty explicit routes is rejected rather than losing them. V12 carries each GOAT Key's plan-window map inside the encrypted
  envelope, separately from ordinary cooldowns. The same Key merges the later
  deadline in each window and keeps the host map when an older package omits
  the field; a changed Key drops the old host map, then applies a valid incoming
  map. Same-Key preservation keeps or merges that map only while the incoming
  credential is still GOAT; moving the same id and the same plaintext to a
  non-GOAT provider, including Custom HTTP, remains a supported remap and
  discards only the GOAT map while ordinary cooldowns stay. Schema 66 and
  payload V12 are internal storage versions, not the product release version.
  Browser
  profiles, login passwords, logs, usage, and machine-local host settings are
  not included. For a rollback, restore a complete data-directory backup,
  including its encryption key, and open it with the earlier binary.
  See [Upgrade and backup](upgrade-backup.md).
- **Plain HTTP warning.** A non-loopback `http://` root URL exposes the Key
  and request contents to the network. Use HTTPS or a trusted LAN only.
- **Administrator password.** The single administrator password is stored as
  an Argon2 hash in SQLite. There is no self-service password recovery —
  protect the data directory.
- **Custom API destinations.** Complete Custom inference Endpoints are
  administrator-trusted. Public, LAN, and loopback HTTP or HTTPS destinations
  are allowed. Metadata, link-local, and opaque IPv4-trick hosts are rejected.
  URL-embedded credentials are rejected; query strings and fragments are
  rejected; secret-bearing requests never follow redirects; dashboard and
  client credentials are never forwarded. Stored Custom and user-defined
  Provider Keys send only to destinations listed on that Key's saved endpoint
  and Origin grants. Official sealed Keys also require the saved protocol
  endpoint ids; clearing them blocks send and stored-Key tests. Editing a
  Provider or Custom URL does not add a grant.

  An explicitly granted configured foreign Origin may send; an ungranted
  override does not. Before decrypting or sending, the Gateway re-reads the
  selected account, binding, Key version, model scope, and grants. Rotating
  or disabling that Key, or narrowing its scope, fails that attempt instead
  of sending the previous Key. Choose destinations you intend to reach from
  this node.
