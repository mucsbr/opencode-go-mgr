# External Integrations

External integrations are optional, locally supported services that extend OCG
Manager. The dashboard keeps its eight core views; supported surfaces appear in
the general **Extensions** group below the Settings divider.

## CPA

CPA (CLI Proxy API) is a local subscription runtime. Open Console Gateway can
manage its supported Codex, Claude, Antigravity, Kimi, and xAI account flows
and route the resulting subscription pool, but CPA remains the owner of OAuth
browser sessions, tokens, auth files, and internal scheduling. OCG stores only
its local connection configuration, the two CPA access credentials, and a local
model snapshot.

The Management Key stays encrypted in OCG storage and, for a managed child,
reaches CPA only as `MANAGEMENT_PASSWORD`. CPA itself requires client
`api-keys` in its config, so the protected Inference Key and any
direct-client keys are necessarily present in CPA's local config under the OCG
data directory. Creating a client key returns that secret once from V3; list
views stay fingerprinted.

Use one of these local deployments:

- **Windows x64, macOS, or Linux x64 desktop app or CLI:** OCG can download
  the official CLIProxyAPI asset for that OS and CPU, keep it under the OCG
  data directory, and start it as an OCG-owned child. After a successful
  installation or manual start, OCG remembers that CPA should run. The child
  stops when OCG exits, and the next OCG process starts it again in the
  background. Clicking **Stop** cancels that startup recovery, including after
  a failed recovery attempt. OCG never stops a CPA process it did not start.
  Other OS/CPU combinations have no official asset and fail the install with
  an explicit reason.
- **Desktop or CLI:** run CPA on the same machine and configure a loopback URL
  such as `http://127.0.0.1:8317`.
- **Docker:** enable the optional Compose sibling described in
  [Docker](docker.md). OCG uses the read-only `http://cpa:8317` service URL;
  the dashboard does not accept a LAN, Internet, or cross-node CPA address.

URLs with embedded credentials, queries, fragments, redirects, or non-loopback
hosts are rejected. Do not reuse an Open Console Gateway Key as either CPA key.

Startup recovery reuses the installed CPA version, configuration, and saved
logins. It attempts startup once per OCG process; a failure remains visible on
the CPA page and does not block OCG or trigger a restart loop. Existing
installations without a saved run intent remain stopped until you start CPA.
External CPA connections, including the Docker sibling, keep their own
lifecycle.

### Connect And Operate

1. On Windows x64, macOS, or Linux x64 (desktop app or CLI), install or start
   the managed CPA runtime from **Extensions → CPA**, or install and start CPA
   yourself on loopback and save its **Management Key** and **Inference Key**.
   The managed runtime generates those keys. Extra direct-client keys sit on
   **Overview**, are shown fingerprinted, and a newly created secret is returned
   once. The OCG-protected Inference Key cannot be deleted. The Management Key
   is not written into CPA's `config.yaml`; the Inference Key and direct-client
   keys are, because CPA requires `api-keys` in that file.
2. Open **Extensions → CPA**, save the local address and both keys when you
   connect an external CPA, then run the connection test. It reports
   reachability, supported CPA version, Management authentication, and
   Inference authentication separately.
   OCG requires CPA 7.1.0 or newer; later major versions continue through the
   same typed response and exact-account validation.
3. A fresh managed installation can start successfully with an empty model
   catalog. This confirms CPA and its local authentication are working; it
   does not make any model routeable. Start an OAuth flow from CPA's account
   table. Browser-callback providers use CPA's loopback callback ports; Kimi
   and xAI use their device-code flow. OCG never runs an OAuth callback server
   and does not restore an old flow after a refresh or restart.
4. Open **Model catalog** and refresh it. The tab shows the saved snapshot as
   selectable cards grouped by the source CPA reported (`owned_by`). A
   highlighted card joins routing; unselected IDs stay in the snapshot but are
   not published. A first refresh, and models newly added by a later refresh,
   stay off until you select them. Catalogs without a saved selection keep
   routing every ID until you change them. A fresh install can start with an
   empty catalog; refresh after OAuth accounts exist.

   Then enable the CPA subscription pool. Its single **CPA subscription pool**
   card on Accounts can be ordered and enabled/disabled like other route
   candidates, but cannot expose a Key, be deleted, or stand in for individual
   CPA OAuth accounts. The card shows the managed runtime as running, stopped,
   not installed, or in an install/start phase; an external connection is
   labeled as such. A running or external pool is not grayed; a stopped,
   missing, or failed managed runtime is. For a managed runtime, extra
   direct-client keys live on Overview; daily use goes through the OCG Access
   Key.

If CPA and another catalog declare the same public model name, the Gateway
lists that name once and considers their routes in the configured account
order. Use the name shown on **Aliases**. Differently named mappings to the
same raw upstream ID remain ambiguous; slash-shaped raw IDs are not turned
into shared aliases.

Disabling the pool removes it from routing without forgetting CPA setup.
**Disconnect and clear** removes OCG's CPA configuration, the pool card, and
the local model snapshot after confirmation; it does not delete CPA's OAuth
files. A CPA fault simply removes that candidate from the current route, so
other eligible OCG accounts can still be selected.

Removing an OCG-managed CPA runtime is different: it deletes that owned
installation, its local runtime configuration, and the CPA OAuth credentials
under the managed `auth/` directory. It never deletes files belonging to an
externally operated CPA.

### Codex Login Methods

Codex offers **browser login** and **device login**. Device login requires an
installed, running OCG-managed CPA with `--codex-device-login` support
(verified with CPA 7.2.152). Open the authorization page and enter the
displayed code; enable device-code login in ChatGPT security or workspace
settings.

Device login does not listen on port 1455, so it also works when Windows
reserves that port. OCG starts a separate contained CPA login process; CPA
exchanges and saves credentials without interrupting the gateway. Cancel,
expiry (about 15 minutes), OCG exit, or a managed runtime lifecycle operation
stops the helper. Cancelling does not delete credentials already saved by CPA.
External CPA connections use browser login: the current CPA version has no
Codex device-login Management API.

### Import A Local CLI Login

The CPA account page offers **new login** and **import from local CLI**.
Detection checks file presence only; clicking a provider's import button reads
that one credential file and sends an allowlisted conversion to CPA. This works
with both managed CPA and a connected local CPA. Open OCG's local dashboard on
the machine that runs the CLI; remote dashboards cannot access these sources.

| CLI | Supported source | Boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Codex | `$CODEX_HOME/auth.json`, default `~/.codex/auth.json` | ChatGPT OAuth with refresh token; API-key, external, and keychain-only logins are not imported |
| Claude Code | `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/.credentials.json`, default `~/.claude/.credentials.json` | OAuth with refresh token and `user:inference`; macOS Keychain requires fresh login unless the CLI already uses its file fallback |
| Kimi Code | `$KIMI_CODE_HOME/credentials/kimi-code.json`, default `~/.kimi-code/credentials/kimi-code.json` | Official Kimi Code OAuth file format |
| Grok CLI | `$GROK_HOME/auth.json`, default `~/.grok/auth.json` | Standard `https://auth.x.ai` OIDC entry with CPA's matching client ID; other keys/issuers are rejected |
| Antigravity | Not supported | No stable compatible local credential storage contract is established; use CPA login |

Sources that cannot be imported from this machine collapse into one tip; hover
for the detection reason and use Fresh sign-in above.

The **quota** on each account row is CPA's own local usage record for that OAuth
account, not the provider's official plan allowance. Empty records are hidden.
**Reset quota** clears CPA's counter only; it does not reset anything at the
provider.

Import is a one-time copy. OCG does not edit the CLI source, persist OAuth
tokens in its database, display them, or keep the two stores synchronized. CPA
owns the imported copy and refreshes it. Both copies share an authorization
grant; refresh or revocation can require another login. Existing matching
imports are not overwritten; remove an obsolete CPA entry explicitly before
replacing it. Avoid managing CPA accounts in another client while importing.
When CPA does not confirm an upload, OCG reports an unconfirmed result; refresh
the account list before retrying. Stable import filenames allow retries to
reconcile the same source identity or unchanged grant instead of blindly
creating another file.

The formats were checked against CPA 7.2.152, official Codex storage, Claude
Code's documented file storage, Kimi Code commit `f9ca333`, and Grok CLI 1.0.13.

## Adding Another Integration

Static external integrations appear in **Extensions**. Contributions include
a typed Dashboard V3 adapter and a documented local boundary for code review.
The contribution path is in
[Extending Open Console Gateway](../maintainer/extending.md).
